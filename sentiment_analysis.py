# 2012 q1
csod.append("Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator instructions.] We’ll take our first question "
            "from Laura Lederman from William Blair. Please go ahead Laura. Laura Lederman – William Blair I’d like to start with multi-product, or multi-pillar deals, and if you look at the quarter what percentage of them were multi-platform. And kind of a similar question, if you could talk about upsell as a percentage of bookings, just to give us a sense of the opportunity that you expanded on in terms of selling into the installed base. Adam Miller In terms of the sale of multiple clouds - so we talked about the four clouds, learning, performance, extended enterprise, and now recruiting - I would say that we continue have at least two clouds in 50% of our deals. Some of them see three, some see even four now. But we’re seeing multiple products being sold in each of our deals, at least 50% of the time. With regard to the shift, or the split, between upsale and new client acquisition, I would say it’s been consistent with our historical track record. Nothing of note as it relates to upsale versus new client acquisition. Laura Lederman – William Blair I realize that the acquisitions of Taleo and SuccessFactors happened relatively recently, but what are you hearing from customers, and do you think you’ve won more business than you would have because of that? And I realize the stories might be anecdotal, but they might prove interesting to us. Adam Miller My quick answer would be not yet, meaning just now as the market’s starting to absorb the news, and as you know, in the large enterprise segment, these are long sales cycles, so that news is starting to hit in current sales cycles. So I think over this quarter and next quarter, I’ll be able to give you a clearer answer. But the news has definitely reached the field, and we are seeing a lot of opportunity now in the market, in particular in the large enterprise space. It was really a three-horse race prior to SAP and Oracle coming into the market, and what we see today is that it’s a two-horse race. If it’s an Oracle client, it’s either us or Oracle, i.e. Taleo, and if it’s an SAP client, it’s us or SuccessFactors. It’s no longer a three-horse race. Operator We’ll take our next question from Greg Dunham from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead Greg. Greg Dunham – Goldman Sachs First question is on pricing. I know you guys rolled out the new bundles earlier this year. There was some pricing dynamics. But one of the bear fears out there is that there’s pricing pressure in the market, because there’s the perception of tougher competition. Can you just address that concern first? And then a follow up question is on the pace of hiring. When you look at the hiring that you did, kind of a 10% sequential increase, was that in line with your expectations? Adam Miller Let me take the second one first. We are hiring exactly on plan. We hire roughly the same number of people every month, and we’ve been doing that consistently over the past several months. And we are exactly on plan from that perspective. With regard to pricing, as we mentioned on an earlier call, pricing’s actually improved in the market, and that’s very specific. Prior to Oracle and SAP getting into the space, we had a round of consolidation of the low-cost competitors. They were the ones that most often would start the price wars, and those guys getting taken out of the market has actually improved pricing overall, for all the vendors in the space, including us. Greg Dunham – Goldman Sachs How has the composition of hiring evolved over the past six months in terms of what type of profile of person are you guys hiring? Adam Miller Well, as you can imagine, we’re seeing a lot of talent being freed up from our prior competitors because of the consolidation, which has raised the bar, I think. The other is while there’s a lot of unemployment, there absolutely is a shortage of skilled labor. But if you’re on a winning team, because of the success we’ve had in the marketplace, we’re able to attract very good talent. And I would say the quality of our sales teams and service teams and technology teams has continued to improve over time because of that. So success breeds success in many ways. Operator And we’ll take our next question from Mark Murphy from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead Mark. Mark Murphy - Piper Jaffray I wanted to ask you about the trajectory of our sales headcount. You had noted earlier that you’re trying to roughly double it year over year by June of this year. Any preliminary sense on how it could trend beyond that, maybe through June of 2013? Presumably maybe you have the luxury here of being able to digest and assimilate some of those hires more than previous years, but I’m wondering how you’re looking at it. Adam Miller Yes, we’ve been aggressively growing our sales teams over the last three years, and we will continue to do that into the future. We haven’t made our final plans yet as it relates to 2013, but I will tell you that we’ve had good success not just acquiring sales talent but also onboarding them and ensuring that they’re productive. And we’ll continue to do that around the world. As we said last year, the growth by team is not consistent. So we will hire more on one team than another. But if you look at it holistically, we’re continuing to aggressively build out our sales force globally. Mark Murphy - Piper Jaffray And Perry, you had mentioned that in Q2 you basically had the toughest comp imaginable for billings year over year. And we’ve known that’s coming for a while. But is there any way you could help us understand what would you think of as a normal Q2 sequential seasonality for billings, based on what you’re seeing in the current climate? Perry Wallack My canned response is that we don’t give guidance on bookings. That said, I think that when you try to look at previous years, and you look at seasonality, between quarters, and you look at relative bookings growth between quarters, you can probably expect things that are in range of those historical seasonalities. Mark Murphy - Piper Jaffray And then finally, Adam, I wanted to ask you, philosophically, where do you stand on the longer-term evolution of the HR software market, just in terms of what customers prefer. And what I’m specifically getting at is I guess the concept of integrated core HR, plus talent management. In other words, what people perceive to be the Workday model, versus running best-of-breed for talent management and best-of-breed for core HR. Do you think that those are going to be distinct and separate? Or do you think that the lines are going to blur over time? Adam Miller Well, I think it depends on the needs of the particular client. Obviously, Workday is focused on unified HCM and performance management, and we’re taking a holistic approach to talent management, including learning and recruiting in the extended enterprise. These are different approaches. That’s allowed us to partner with Workday, and it’s allowed both of us to compete effectively against both Oracle and SAP. And I think we’ll be able to continue to do that over time. Operator We’ll take our next question from Rick Sherlund from Nomura. Please go ahead Rick. Rick Sherlund – Nomura I wondered if you could just give us a little granularity on the bookings quarter. Revenues were about in line with the Street, but the bookings were quite a bit better. Was there anything in the mix of the bookings number? I think I heard you say there was no change in terms, that it was similar? And certainly the long term was actually less, so that was encouraging as well. Any change in the mix of billings, service versus product, or any other insight you can give us on that? Adam Miller Like I said in the prepared remarks, there were really no anomalies. There were no large deals that were billed multiyear or up front, or anything like that. And the historical averages of the amounts billed up front were pretty consistent in the quarter. And the mix of revenue across the different teams, whether that was direct sales in the U.S., alliances, ADP, Europe, federal government, that was all roughly the same as our historical mixes. Rick Sherlund – Nomura And any insight you can give us on enterprise spending? There seems to be controversy out there after Cisco’s comments about enterprise spending weakening. Have you seen any evidence of that? It’s certainly not evident in your billings number, but I’m curious, anecdotally, what your observation might be. Adam Miller We’ve seen no evidence there. What we have seen is a clear shift to the cloud. So organizations that were selling legacy software or hardware are having a more difficult time than some of the cloud providers. And I think we’re specifically seeing a shift to talent management being strategic. We’re having higher level conversations in the organizations. The initiatives have become global instead of departmental. And we are seeing a continuous and very clear demand and preference for buying the solution in the cloud instead of buying something that’s on-premise. So we’ve not seen any slowdown in our business, and even more particularly we’ve seen no slowdown in Europe either, where I think the market would assume there would be a slowdown. We’re seeing very strong demand throughout EMEA, both in the near term and longer term. Rick Sherlund – Nomura And the acquisition of Sonar6, oftentimes companies on non-GAAP numbers exclude the writedown of deferreds in calculating the non-GAAP numbers. It sounds like that’s not your intent? You’re just going to leave that out? Is that correct? Perry Wallack Yeah, that’s our intent. Operator And we’ll take our next question from Michael Huang from Needham. Please go ahead Michael. Michael Huang – Needham & Company In the case of the joint customers, and opportunities with Workday, are more of these customers going to Cornerstone for performance, or Workday for performance? And could you provide some color around that? Adam Miller In most of the deals now, where Workday had already been there, and they brought us in as a learning solution, it will be Workday performance and Cornerstone learning, specifically. Michael Huang – Needham & Company And just another question around the strength of billings. Obviously very impressive. Just wanted to get your view on how much of that was driven by improvements in sales productivity versus driven by the fact that you’ve been ramping distribution so aggressively. Adam Miller It’s probably more the ramp. We are seeing some improvements in productivity, particularly as it relates to the overall pipeline development. So I think you’re going to see more of that in future quarters. But generally there were no anomalies this quarter. As Perry mentioned, there were no disproportionately sized deals. There was nothing unusual that happened in the quarter. And in fact, if anything, we had some notably significantly sized deals that did not close in the quarter. They closed after the quarter end. So you still had the bookings growth. Michael Huang – Needham & Company And last question, just on the new recruiting product. In terms of some of the early opportunities you’re seeing there, are they with new customers? Existing customers? And enterprise, or mid-market? Adam Miller So the beta program we did was with existing clients. We are now selling it generally, and so we are selling recruiting in some of the new deals. And we’re continuing to upsell it to the installed base. I think we’ll see more installed base sales in initially, and over time it will probably shift to new sales, new clients. Michael Huang – Needham & Company And any particular flavor with respect to large enterprise or mid-market around interest in recruiting? Adam Miller No, what’s interesting is we’ve seen it across the board. So we have some global enterprises, we have some mid-market companies, we have some nonprofits, and for-profits in a variety of different vertical sectors. There is no consistency about who’s buying recruiting. I think what we have seen as being consistent is those that are buying more of the suites - so our clients that are already using learning and performance and the extended enterprise are more likely to also purchase recruiting, at least up front. Operator And our next question is from Scott Berg from Feltl. Please go ahead Scott. Scott Berg – Feltl I only have one question, and it’s around ASPs in the quarter. It looks like your net new customer adds were essentially flat year over year, 85 to 86 by my count. But your billings came in really strong. Is that a reflection of general ASPs being stronger year over year? Or is it more customer mix, more larger customers than relatively smaller customers? Adam Miller I think you see a little bit of the reflection of less pricing competition. So the pricing has improved, as I mentioned earlier. The other is we have a very well-diversified quarter. I think we had performance across all teams and all segments. And so we don’t see any real anomalies from our standard pricing other than overall the tide has risen, and we’re seeing good performance across the board. So it wasn’t over-weighted in any one particular segment, and the same is true as we look ahead at the pipeline. So we’re feeling good about where we are right now. Operator And we’ll take our next question coming from Brandon Barnicle from Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead. Brandon Barnicle – Pacific Crest Securities Adam, I just wanted to follow up on the recruiting question, and specifically whether you guys have been able to pick up any new sales talent out of the consolidation that’s gone on in the sector. Adam Miller Yes. It’s primarily sales people and service people. We’re not really looking for product development or technology, or administrative functions. But we have been picking up specifically sales talent and service talent. Delivery people. Brandon Barnicle – Pacific Crest Securities And I just wanted to follow up on your comments about the macro. Specifically, some folks have been concerned about financial service weakness. You guys have pretty good exposure there. Have you seen anything on that side? Adam Miller Nothing at all. We continue to sell. In fact, it remains one of our best sectors, and we’ve seen both upsale and new client acquisition from our financial services clients. Part of that, keep in mind, is that one of the benefits of Cornerstone is cost savings. And so we typically see that the more the system is used, the more a company can save. And that’s helped us in macroeconomic uncertain times. Operator Now I would like to turn the conference back to Adam Miller for concluding remarks. Adam Miller Thank you all for participating, and we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter.")
# 2012 q2
csod.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) Our first questioner in queue "
            "is Laura Lederman with William Blair. Please go ahead, your line is open.Laura Lederman – William Blair & Company LLCYes, thank you so much for taking my questions. Great quarter, I appreciate it. Given released on quarter and bookings especially given the very tough comparison, I was wondering with the pipeline looks like going into Q3, and also what is the ratability look like in the quarter, was it back end loaded, not back end loaded, how did it feel as you move through the second quarter?Adam MillerSo, when I would say is that similar to last quarter, where we said there were a couple of deals that had slipped, and made the second quarter a little bit easier. The same thing actually occurred in Q2, bringing some of that business into Q3. So, we feel confident about our guidance than where we are. and of course, there [are lawyers] sitting in the room.Laura Lederman – William Blair & Company LLCAnd the ratability; was there any difference than usual Q2 in terms of when the business came in?Adam MillerWhat do you mean by ratability?Laura Lederman – William Blair & Company LLCCame in…Adam MillerYou mean (inaudible).Laura Lederman – William Blair & Company LLCYes. In other words month one, month two versus month three, when the business came into that and look like a normal Q2?Adam MillerYeah, it was a little bit better than Q1, which was very back-end weighted. Q2 was more typical.Laura Lederman – William Blair & Company LLCAnother question from me, and then I’ll pass it on, which is European business, any signs of any slowing there, any higher level of approvals needed, and I guess related question to that is the deals that’s set from Q1 into Q2 and Q2 to Q3, do you think that’s economic or just kind of normal?Adam MillerYeah. So the deals that is set or deals that were externally large, and so those tend to have more prolonged procurement processes. And we go back and forth, so that’s fairly typical, I would say about those deals. it was nothing related to the macroeconomic environment causing those delays. And with regard to Europe in particular, we are seeing no slowdown in our business in Europe. As you know, we’ve done extremely well over four different recessions and our product tends to save our clients’ money upfront, and often helps improve compliance as well. Therefore it works just as well in a recessionary environment as it does in a more robust economic environment.Laura Lederman – William Blair & Company LLCThanks a lot. I’ll just come back to another queue.Adam MillerThank you.Perry WallackThank you.OperatorThank you. Our next questioner in queue is Mark Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead, your line is open.Mark R. Murphy – Piper Jaffray, Inc.Yes, thank you. Congrats on the strength. Adam, I wanted to ask you how you would assess the receptivity of customers to your vision of recruiting a Talent acquisition, in terms of how it’s unique being natively social, is that something that’s automatically resonating or is this something that maybe takes a few demos for people who watch on just because it’s new and different?Adam MillerSo, I would say, it very much depends on the audience. So if we’re talking to industry people for example, analysts or media, or second or third time buyers, it resonates immediately. With regard to what resonates in general about our recruiting cloud. I would say less sophisticated audiences really resonate with the fact that was integrated with the rest of the suite. So, whether that’s existing clients, understanding how it ties into what they’re already doing with us or it’s new prospects looking at an overall talent management suite, it’s the integration that really attract them.Mark R. Murphy – Piper Jaffray, Inc.So if you look at the flow of the increase or maybe RFPs that you're getting from customers and prospects, if you think about that in recent months and I know the product essentially is in totally [GA], but how is that being split across maybe the recruiting product versus everything else, I mean is the recruiting 5%, 10%, 15% of the increase that you’re getting?Adam MillerWell, let me be really specific, we used to exclude deals we qualify ourselves out, if recruiting was the major component in the deal. So for example, if a company was looking for talent management system, but in important part of that talent management system was recruiting, and in particular, if they wanted to roll out recruiting in the beginning of the implementation, we would opt out of the deal, we would just walk away. And that is no longer true.So we will stay in all of those deals now. It has resulted in an increase in the number of our bets, it's also resulted early on in a pretty big increase in RFPs that were responding too that do include recruiting. We're still not really going after standalone recruiting deals, although I won’t say we’re never doing that, because some of the reps are pursuing recruiting only deals right now. And obviously if it was a client, they already had purchased something other than recruiting. So I won't consider that as a stand-alone deal, because they already have learning or performance or succession or collaboration today.Mark R. Murphy – Piper Jaffray, Inc.Got it. Okay, one last one. Adam, I wanted to ask you a high level kind of workforce in demographic drivers’ question. We have been hearing that the concept of development people kind of becoming an elevated focus, just because you have the shortage of skilled labor that’s out there in the market externally. And that at the same time, you have this younger generation of workers; they want to be developed almost as much as they want to be compensated these days. I wanted to ask you, is that something that’s tangible to you and may be have you thought about the duration of those trends? Is there kind of a multi-year window where those high level drivers are accelerated?Adam MillerYes, Mark, you know that sometimes we talk about things before other people understand what we are talking about and this is one of those topics were we’ve been preaching this for a while, the inevitable retirement of the baby boomers, the lack of skilled workers or experienced workers in the work force, combined with the rise of the Millennials and there likelihood of having seven careers in their life time, thus carrying a lot more about career development and career pathing about any individual position.Those things are coming to bare, people are now widely talking about it, you can read the harbor business review any month and probably fine articles about talent management, its in the business process all the time now and certain industries are starting to become acutely aware of the baby boomer retirement, all of which cause you to have to do two things.Number one, you have to train more junior people to be able to handle more senior responsibility earlier in their career, because again you don’t have enough people to back fill – those senior people retiring. And number two, you need to be able to retain your Millennials who have a propensity to switch career. So you want them to be able to be developed in switch careers in their job or in their cooperation rather than leading to move to another organization. And so both of those things tide back to development as you know that’s definitely a sweet spot for Cornerstone. So as people start thinking more holistically about talent management including the need to continuously develop employees that plays really well into our strength.Mark R. Murphy – Piper Jaffray, Inc.Thank you.OperatorThank you, sir. Our next questioner in queue is Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open, your questions please.Michael B. Nemeroff – Credit SuisseHey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions, nice quarter.Adam MillerThank you.Michael B. Nemeroff – Credit SuisseI’d like to talk about maybe the partnership and the alliance revenue in the quarter. A couple of quarters ago, I think you’d mentioned Adam that it represented about 25% of the business or new bookings. I was wondering if you could maybe give us an update or quantify as it was in Q2, and then also if you could talk specifically about the partnerships you have with Workday and NADP and whether the deal sizes that you’re getting from them are consistent or growing.Adam MillerSure. So, I think historically we had talked about 15% in the past moving to 20% more recently. And then with our long-term, we could get up to potentially 25% of our sales being indirect. We’re not moving from that. We think has we continue to increase distribution globally, and this is not a U.S. phenomenon. This is really a global phenomenon that we will be able to move up that the overall scale of indirect sales.With regard to our existing partners, we see different partners going through different life cycles almost the same way that a client will go through a client life cycle. The partners go through a life cycle. We have some new partners that are just now getting fully up to speed and just now starting to produce. So, I would consider partners like Lucian in that budget, which used to be SunGard after a merge with Datatel that’s focused on the higher Ed market.We have some partnerships in Europe and Latin America that are very early stage, that are just getting up to speed. We have partnerships there in Asia-Pac that are sort of early stage other than Talent 2, but Talent 2 recently did a go-private transaction, and so there's been some change in activity there, but that will pick back up now, that they’ve been through that transaction.With regard to ADP, as you know, we've been expanding our reach within ADP; today we work with really all aspects of ADP from national accounts to majors all the way down to total source. And we are seeing continued good pipeline growth in repeatable business from that, despite the fact that they’ve built their our own product or acquired part of their own product, and we suspect that we will continue at that level what we don't necessarily expect the double growth from there. And then lastly with regard to Workday, it's a really joint selling arrangement, we sell together, we have a very strong and growing sales force, they have a very strong sales force, and we teamed our sales forces together, and its been very effective in the field. So we have a lot of activity going on there as well.Michael B. Nemeroff – Credit SuisseThanks, Adam.OperatorYes sir our next questioner in queue is Pat Walravens with JMP. Please go ahead, your line is open.Patrick Walravens – JMP SecuritiesThank you very much. So the demand environment sounds terrific for you guys. What is the constraint on growth is it sales capacity, is it service capacity, and how fast can you grow whatever that capability is?Adam MillerReally I think the constraint is our ability to effectively recruit non-Board people, it goes back to talent management at the end of day, how quickly can we build out our sales and service capability, we want to do those and think, you don't want to get the sales teams far ahead of your services capability. At the same time you want to make sure you're hiring strong sales people, you have the right infrastructure in place and you have time to sufficiently on-board them.So we’re doing all those things. We’ve been consistently hiring. we will probably continue to consistently hire in both sales and services and may even accelerate that, not on a relative basis, but on an absolute basis as the teams grow, we have a greater ability to handle bigger throughput with regard to hiring and on-boarding people. We also because of the consolidation in this space obviously have been opportunistic about bringing on people from our former competitors, who don’t want to work for large ERP company. And so we have been able to be very disappointed about getting the top talent from those organizations, bringing them over in some ways, that is zero-sum game. so we’re taking some of the best people and putting them on our side instead of their side, all of which will result in continued long-term growth.Patrick Walravens – JMP SecuritiesI mean just sort of try to put a marker out there. Is it possible to double sales capacity again over the next 12 months or is that too much?Adam MillerIt is possible.Patrick Walravens – JMP SecuritiesYeah, okay. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next questioner in queue is Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Please go ahead, your line is open.Rick G. Sherlund – Nomura Securities International, Inc.Yeah, thanks. I’m curious on the ERP side, work on SAP if you can just share anecdotally what you’re seeing out in the field or I understand that they’re focusing on integrating, but what are the other salespeople doing, are they just be focused, what you’re saying?Adam MillerWe have two very different approaches as you know from Oracle and SAP. Oracle has followed their typical model and so Taleo was all but disappeared inside of Oracle and is now operating as just a subunit or I would say just functionally within Oracle. So we’re seeing them less often now, and we’ve seen a lot of their people leave right away. By contrast, SAP has kept SuccessFactors a separate business unit, but because of the Ariba acquisition, and because of the move of the HCM team into the SuccessFactors organization. So the former HCM team from SAP moving into the SuccessFactors organization. You do have a lot of overlap of personnel. we have a lot of people with similar jobs being merged together. and so I think there is some uncertainty about what’s going to happen next. There also obviously is a lot of integration work going on.And I believe a real deep focus or deep focusing from what we consider core talent management. And so that’s given us the opportunity to continue to enhance our solutions, and get ahead of the curve, so whereas six months ago, I think the products were fairly similar. I think we are now left that work in the road and will start to see big differences in the products as well as in the service offerings.So we’re continuing to build out our internal ability to service our clients, and supplement the kind of service offerings that they get to make sure that they have a positive experience. By contrast, I think the ERP guys are working with their third-party partners and in some cases, moving to low-cost providers to provision that service offering. So you end up with a big difference over time, not just in the solution itself, but also in the service offering.Rick G. Sherlund – Nomura Securities International, Inc.Okay. and then billings numbers, you had a really tough compare this quarter. is there anything in terms of the composition of your pipeline in terms of maybe mix of business, particularly large deals, anything that we should consider as we estimate billings curve for next quarter?Adam MillerYeah, I mean I’d say two things there. One, I don’t think there was anything unusual about the quarter. We’re seeing really strong performance from not just the enterprise team, but also the mid-market team. As we’ve mentioned previously that the CSB part of our business is still small. So, I wouldn’t focus too much on that right now with regard to the overall numbers.But what I would say is that if you were to normalize last year’s numbers instead of 90% growth for the quarter. You look at our more typical 60% billings growth, then this quarter would resulted in 80% bookings growth approximately. So, we’re talking about a pretty strong quarter. And I don’t want to understate that.Rick G. Sherlund – Nomura Securities International, Inc.To extrapolate that to Q3 then?Adam MillerWell, I don’t want to get carried away.Rick G. Sherlund – Nomura Securities International, Inc.Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next questioner in queue is Greg Dunham with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Greg Dunham – Goldman SachsHi, thanks for taking my question. One more billings question, given that the timing of the capacity, how is that you’ve made looking back or I was expecting this year to be actually more back-end loaded. So, the strength in 2Q kind of surprise me, do you think that the capacity that came on contributed early or was this just upside driven by existing sales people?Adam MillerIt was both. I think our win rates have improved. But at the same time I would say, we are getting better at on boarding our people, and I talk about in some previous calls. One of the things that we’ve been focused on over the last 18 months has been our ability to effectively on board new salespeople considering how quickly we’ve been ramping the sales team. We thought that was a really important metric to track, and we are doing well on that front, particularly with regard to mid-market salespeople. So I believe it's a combination, it's the ability to have more productivity early particularly in the mid-market from new reps, as well as, just an ability to win more in bigger deals on the enterprise front.Greg Dunham – Goldman SachsOkay. And one quick follow-up to Perry. Did FX impact the revenue number at all in the outlook?Perry WallackWell, if you look at the financials what you’ll see is in our other income or expense is about $420,000 loss. That was mostly due to unrealized losses on marking-to-market anything from receivables, to bank accounts or even in the inter company loan. So we have very, very little realized loss, and then what I would point out is for year-to-date it's little less than $200,000.Greg Dunham – Goldman SachsOkay. Thank you.Adam MillerWe don't expect it to vary from that pattern for the rest of the year.Greg Dunham – Goldman SachsAll right. Thank you.OperatorThank you sir. Our next questioner in queue is Michael Huang with Needham. Please go ahead your line is open.Marc Fuller – Needham & Co. LLCHi guys it’s actually Marc Fuller on for Michael Huang. Just quick questions kind of on going forward, you mentioned few of the new growth areas like recruiting, SMB, Asia-Pacific, what you kind of most excited about, and what do you think we kind of a strongest contributors as you kind of exit point well in the 2013?Adam MillerI’ve been pretty consistent about this, I think my favorite remains public sector as the growth engine, we're seeing a lot of opportunity in federal, state and local, and then you also have higher end K-12. So we think there's a lot of opportunity there, but really what is driving our growth is the fact that we have all of these different growth engines all hitting at once. So we’ve expanded our enterprise team, we’re also expanding globally with both in Asia-Pac as well as continued expansion throughout EMEA. Our mid-market team continues to grow, we built out an SMB team, our distribution channels keep strengthening, and I think relatively soon we should be able to talk about more strength there. and so we’re seeing the ability to really sell across-the-board in all these different channels, and that’s what’s really not just driving the growth, but enabling us to sustain growth.Marc Fuller – Needham & Co. LLCWell, thank you, Adam.OperatorThank you, sir. Our next questioner in queue is Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest. Please go ahead, your line is open.Brendan Barnicle – Pacific Crest SecuritiesThanks, guys. Adam, I was wondering now as you’ve got recruiting and you’ve got to fairly complete HR suite put together. what’s the next logical app area, please try to expand into, is there another part of HR or is there an adjacent area that makes sense to start thinking about?Adam MillerI would say a couple of things. the number one, we think there’s a lot of gaps in what we’re doing. so we’re trying to fill in our gaps, our strategy we talk about the acronym SMART, it’s really about social. so making sure, what we’re doing is user centric with social elements not just social recruiting, but social performance, social learning and of course, social collaboration, mobile, so as more and more mobile devices are in the hands of people at the workforce. we think it’s really important to have a very deep mobile strategy and mobile execution. analytics, today we have over 9 million subscribers. we’re starting to collect a very significant amount of data. and so there is a big data play here, and the ability to keep driving analytics as part of our overall solution. Recruiting, which we've obviously rolled out, we're also going to be strengthening our on-boarding functionality to go with recruiting. And lastly, the overall technology we believe, we need to stay on the cutting edge of what’s out there, and we need to make sure that we're really building a true engine architecture, leveraging, web services technology leveraging all the latest and greatest tools to ensure that we’re staying up-to-date in our technology, and make it easier for people to access our platform and expand upon our platform.Brendan Barnicle – Pacific Crest SecuritiesFollowing up on that technology innovation keeping your analytics advances, are you using the tools from some of the newer big data platforms for your analytics or what are you baking around with design.Adam MillerSo we’re in the design phase of that, we’re looking all the latest technologies to determine our next move with regard to big data. To date we've been leveraging the Sequel Technologies, Microsoft...Brendan Barnicle – Pacific Crest SecuritiesGreat. And then on the pricing front, have you noticed any changes that all, I know you’ve mentioned SuccessFactors and Taleo earlier, but are you noticing any change in pricing, and I ask it two ways, one in terms of sort of a new core business and then two in terms of upsell/crosssell?Adam MillerYeah, so with regard to the core business, we've talked, I think two calls ago about the change in pricing and that’s remained fairly constant. We’re not seeing those price wars any more. They just have gone away, the low-cost competitors out of the space, and we're seeing just much more rational competition today. With regard to the ability to upsell as the products have gotten stronger, it's been easier and easier to crosssell and upsell, and so that's why today you see over 60% of our clients using performance and succession. We’re seeing the ability to sell the extended enterprise capabilities, collaboration capabilities and as we continue to strengthen these products, it just means greater ability to upsell.Brendan Barnicle – Pacific Crest SecuritiesGreat, thanks guys.OperatorThank you, sir. Our next questioner in queue is Scott Berg with Northland Capital. Please go ahead, your line is open. Scott Berg, your line is open. Please check your mute button.Scott Berg – Northland Capital MarketsHow is that, better? Sorry about that. Hey, Adam and Perry, congratulations on a great quarter. I got quick one since most have undertaken. Can you give any other additional color on the CSB deal flow in the quarter? I know you give comps obviously on the core products, but just looking to I guess colorize some comments on this first initial quarters of sales?Adam MillerYeah, I would say just overall retention is better than we expected. So, we were looking at historical retention, obviously SMB doesn’t have the same kind of retention rates we’ve traditionally have which is over 95%. And it’s better than expected with regard to their history. The other is we’ve had more deal flow. We were able to grow the sales team pretty aggressively right away, and not have any drop in productivity. So, that’s pretty impressive as well.We’re also seeing the ability to renew the one year deals as three year deals getting them more consistent with the way we do business and that also leads to more long-term success. So overall, we’re very excited about what we’ve seen. And we’re continuing to improve that product as well. We’re continuing to increase our marketing spend there and continuing to build out the sales force there. So, we’re very bullish about CSB today.Scott Berg – Northland Capital MarketsGreat, that’s all I have. Thank you.OperatorThank you, sir. And we do have time for one final question. Our final questioner comes from Brad Sills with ThinkEquity. Please go ahead your line is now open.Bradley Hartwell Sills – ThinkEquity LLCHey guys, just a question please on where you are seeing the most impact from the competitive disruption, the deals that are leading with learning our performance or even recruiting.Adam MillerThat’s a hard question to answer because I would say it’s actually all three, obviously the learning deals, we were all made the dominant player this just makes us more dominant and so it’s been very helpful for learning deals, where we’ve been surprised on the learning is the fact that we’re able to saw learning even in cases, where they are already using the ERP vendor, and already using that the acquisition either Taleo or Success Factors for either recruiting or performance management, so we’re able to penetrate even the accounts that we shouldn’t theoretically have been able to penetrate and win those deals, after learning side, with regard to performance, we had a lot of strength in the mid-market, and obviously in the SMB space around performance, so that continuous to be very strong and the change was really when our low cost competitors got taken out, not with the most recent acquisitions and then with regard to recruiting, it is fairly obvious that the disruption of Taleo, who is a dominant player recruiting timed with all launch of the recruiting cloud just worked down really well for us, and so we are seeing the ability to sell into our existing clients as well as two new prospects recruiting as really as now, and so we’re very positive about that as well.Bradley Hartwell Sills – ThinkEquity LLCGot it, thanks Adam.OperatorThank you, that does conclude our time for questions, I’d now like to turn the program back over to management for any additional or closing remarksAdam MillerThank you all for participating. As we said, we’re very positive about the quarter that we just had and we’re feeling good about the business overall. the change in the competitive landscape clearly has benefitted Cornerstone and we think that will continue into the future. Thank you very much.Perry WallackThanks everybody.OperatorThank you, gentlemen. Again, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. Attendees, you may disconnect at this time.")
# 2012 q3
csod.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you, ladies and gentlemen. (Operator Instructions) We have a "
            "question from Mark Murphy of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.Mark Murphy – Piper JaffrayYes, thank you. Congrats on the strong quarter. Adam, I wanted to ask how you would characterize the deal pipeline for Q4 and beyond and I’m wondering, is the composition of the pipeline shifting at all toward larger deals or at all toward full suite deals, just in light of the amount of chaos and uncertainty that is facing many of these Oracle and SAP customers? Do you get a feeling at all that they are contemplating more of an all-in move over to Cornerstone?Adam MillerWell, I’d love to answer that, but let me instead talk about the historical performance and historically, particularly in the third quarter, you do see that we had a number of large deals that were takeaways from both Oracle and SAP, and I suspect that trend will continue. Certainly we’ve seen that trend now, two quarters in a row.Mark Murphy – Piper JaffrayOkay, great. And as a follow-up, Perry, I wanted to ask you about the linearity of software bookings during Q3. Obviously this has been one of the worst technology earnings season that we’ve all seen in several years and yet your results look remarkably strong here. So I’m just wondering if there was maybe anything you saw in terms of any new oscillations, in terms of monthly bookings linearity or maybe anything else that you’re tracking internally in terms of the long-term leading indicators.Perry WallackYeah, there was no anomaly. Everything was pretty close to being in line with historical averages.Mark Murphy – Piper JaffrayOkay, then one last one, Adam, on the recruiting front. I was wondering if you can help us, maybe with how many times you have sold the product, how many are live in production, if any, at this point and maybe just what kind of feedback are you getting thus far on the technology?Adam MillerWe haven’t disclosed any specific numbers about how many Recruiting Cloud sales have been or how many are in production right now, but I will say that adoption has been stronger than we originally anticipated. I think that’s clearly related to the fact that both Taleo and Kenexa have been acquired in the past year and that’s opened up the market for us. Our product had started out very strong and with each progressive release, it’s getting much stronger and we do expect this to have some significant impact on our financial results next year and as I alluded to in my earlier comments, we did see an up-tick, for example, at HR Tech, which was partially related to the fact that we now have recruiting.Mark Murphy – Piper JaffrayThank you very muchAdam MillerThank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question is from Brendan Barnicle of Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.Brendan Barnicle – Pacific Crest SecuritiesThanks so much. Guys, you had a great increase in deferred revenue sequentially and you alluded to the new customer additions driving that. Is there any way to give us a breakdown there between, kind of what portion of that was deferred revenue rather was new business and new customers versus the installed base?Adam MillerWe saw no difference in our historical averages between new client sales and incremental up sales from existing accounts, let’s say, there is no anomaly there at all. This was mostly driven by new client sales.Brendan Barnicle – Pacific Crest SecuritiesAnd then Adam, I was wondering if you could give us a little more color on dollar renewals within the installed base and what you are seeing on the renewal side in the quarter?Adam MillerAgain pretty close to historical averages…Brendan Barnicle – Pacific Crest SecuritiesCan you remind us again what that is?Adam MillerWe’ve been 95% since inception and as the client gets, base gets bigger, we suspect that it will become more difficult to sustain particularly as we do more and more work down market, we do often have more turnover. Nonetheless, we have remained on track year-to-date with our averages.Brendan Barnicle – Pacific Crest SecuritiesGreat. And then Perry just one for you on gross margin, because you mentioned on the call, you expect them to continue to improve annually. Can you remind us again where you think those top out at, where your kind of target gross margins are?Perry WallackWe really haven’t come off of our original guidance that we gave during the IPO road show, which was 75% plus and a time table of three to five years where we said we hope to overachieve both the time it takes to get there and the percentage. Looking at our margins year-to-date and already really approaching that 75%, we would expect that we do overachieve both the time it takes to get there and the percentage. But my closest color that we give on that is that we expect them to improve on an annual basis not necessarily on a sequential quarter-to-quarter basis.Brendan Barnicle – Pacific Crest SecuritiesGreat. Thanks, guys.Perry WallackSure.OperatorThank you. The next question is from Michael Nemeroff of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.Michael Nemeroff – Credit SuisseYes, thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on a really outstanding quarter. Adam, I was wondering if you could just discuss some of your focus on the indirect channel into 2013, and maybe if you can give us just an idea of what percent of the revenues now are partner influence and how you see that trending over the next year or two.Adam MillerSo, I view this year 2012 as the building year for the ecosystem. We’ve seen a lot of shifting in the ecosystem. Historically it’s been somewhere between 15% and 20% of incremental sales that come from indirect channels, now some of that is indirect influence, some of that is re-sold directly by the channel partners, and that’s a global number.What I would tell you is that with the changing of the guard around the industry consolidation, we’re also seeing a changing of ecosystem partners, and that’s created a lot of opportunity for Cornerstone. So we are very aggressively building out our ecosystem globally in all segments, meeting top tier companies, working in the HRO business, higher quality partners regionally and vertically, as well as working with different partners in the different business segments that we now compete in for example SMB. And I suspect that we’ll see an uptick in the business that we’ll receive from these channel partners going to next year.Michael Nemeroff – Credit SuisseAnd are those deals typically larger or of similar size to normal deals?Adam MillerIt just various; it depends on particular segment that the partner operates in. We think about our ecosystem in a segmented way. So we have partners for very large enterprise deals. We have partners for very small SMB deals. We have partners that are domestic and others that are international. We also have partners that are in specific verticals like Ellucian in Higher Ed. And so as those partner relationships strengthen over time, combined with our expansion of alliance partners, I think you are going to see us continue to strengthen in that area.Michael Nemeroff – Credit SuisseGreat, thanks and then one for Perry, if I may, just looking at the sequential increase from Q3 to Q4 in the bookings last year, I was just wondering was there any pull forward of deals into Q3 that would preclude you guys from growing at least sequentially the same amount from Q3 to Q4 in 2012 that you did in 2011.Perry WallackSo as you know we can’t really comment on Q4, what I would say is that there was nothing of any anomaly in our Q3 deal mix that wasn’t consistent from prior years.Michael Nemeroff – Credit SuisseThanks guys.OperatorThank you. The question is from Greg Dunham of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.Greg E. Dunham – Goldman Sachs & Co.Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First one for you Perry, you kind of called out the DSOs, cited at three reasons for that. How much - when you look at the ageing of your receivables, how abnormal is that or is it typically normal and just that we did a number of big deals and we’ll collect the cash here next quarter. How should we think about that?Perry WallackI mean look with respect to cash flow it’s much more of a focus for us on an annual basis and really Q4, so that’s when we really, really start to focus on it. As you know we sell to really, really big customers. We don’t have any issues in getting paid. We just have sometimes issues in how long it takes to get paid. We saw no degradation and in fact we have I believe what people would find as industry leading allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense because of those gold standard large corporate receivables.Adam MillerAnd by leading he means a low number, not a high number.Greg E. Dunham – Goldman Sachs & Co.Right.Perry WallackRight, industry-leading low, so it will be our focus in Q4 and I’m sure we will use a little more increased pressure and we’re feeling about our guidance on our cash flow from ops for the full year and not having moved off of that number, quite confident.Greg E. Dunham – Goldman Sachs & Co.Okay. I want to follow-up on Mark’s question earlier. We are seeing a number of companies that are struggling, facing macro pressures, slower deal signings and then these numbers are completely contrary to that dynamic. And so, really the question is, are there any regions or any verticals where you’ve seen any sort of slowdown or anything maybe early in Q4 that has given you any sort of pause as to your aggressive investment plans?Adam MillerWell, I mean there is two sectors in particular segment of the market that people tend to have the most concern about and those are Europe and the public sector and both of those have been extremely strong for us all year, including in the third quarter. We are continuing to invest heavily in all segments of the market. We’re seeing opportunity in SMB because there’s very little competition in that segment now. We continue to expand our mid-market team where we just see continued momentum.Enterprise business remains robust, including at the highest end of the market, including in deals where you have alignment between SAP and SuccessFactors, we’re still winning, or Oracle and Taleo, but we’re still winning, and we’re not seeing any regional slowdown either. We’re starting our expansion today in both Latin America and Asia-Pacific. It’s because we are selling something that really works in any economy; in an economy that’s recessionary we offer our clients cost savings and improved compliance and in economies that are growing we offer our clients ways to better engage and develop their employees and improve productivity. So we’ve seen the ability to grow over the last decade through both good times and bad.Greg E. Dunham – Goldman Sachs & Co.Thanks, guys.Perry WallackThank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question is from Pat Walravens of JMP. Your line is open.Patrick D. Walravens – JMP SecuritiesGreat, thank you. Can you guys hear me okay.Adam MillerYes.Perry WallackYes.Patrick D. Walravens – JMP SecuritiesOkay, hi, guys. So I have two questions both on recruiting, Adam, I guess for you. First of all, can you just, very high level give us some idea of what are some of the additional features that are going to come out in the later releases of recruiting, and you suggested there would be more and more anonymous we had more releases?And then secondly, it was interesting to me that Workday announced their recruiting product almost two years before it’s going to be generally available and they said they don’t usually do that, so that made me think there must be some interesting dynamics going on in this segment, I was wondering if you could comment what those might be?Adam MillerWell, let me take the second first. Obviously, the fact that Taleo who is the number one recruiting player and Kenexa who was the number two recruiting player were both acquired in a six-month period, it creates lots of opportunity in that market. You have a lot of disruptions in the specific ATS market and that’s created opportunity for us and for Workday and that’s why they are being a little bullish about their statements around the recruiting products happening as you said two years out.With regard to what we are doing we are actively selling our existing recruiting cloud, we won an award for it already and we are seeing a lot of uptick in the marketplace for it. We think of our recruiting product is really the combination of two different types of products that existed in the recruiting market. You had traditionally enterprise applicant tracking systems or ATS systems that were out there. These were systems very focused on managing large numbers of applicants and managing all the compliance and reporting requirements around recruiting regulation.Separately, you had a more nascent industry of social recruiting companies that were leveraging the power of social graphs and social networking and the connections amongst people in places like Facebook and LinkedIn to drive more sourcing or more effective sourcing in the recruiting process.We’re really the first company to give at an enterprise level both things in a single product, we organically build both things; we focused on the social sourcing piece first, because that was highly differentiated from the pre-existing recruiting companies. We are now actively engaged in finishing up or catching up in the enterprise ATS area. So with our current release in November, we’re putting out offer letter management.At that point, we enable everything from sourcing at candidate through screening the applicant through making the offer and moving on to on boarding, and right around the corner from that we’re doing more of the compliance reporting requirements, which meet very specific governmental regulations for organizations working in or with the public sector. And after that we are moving on to more innovative integrations with interesting companies out there like HireVue and more advanced functionality that the other systems don’t do around things like campus recruiting.Patrick D. Walravens – JMP SecuritiesThank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question is from Michael Huang of Needham & Company. Your line is open.Michael Huang – Needham & CompanyThanks very much. Just a couple of quick one for you guys. So first of all just Adam, in terms of the BP win, I’m wondering if you could talk to the cost savings or business case to move from a 120 systems to a single Cornerstone OnDemand one, and could you share with us like what are you doing for performance management right now if anything and what’s the opportunity around that?Adam MillerYeah, so I don’t, obviously can’t give the specific numbers around the business case, but what I will tell you generically is that, they are reducing the number of systems they have from the 120 to 1, therefore they are eliminating lots of hardware costs, associated with managing those systems, lots of related IT costs associated with maintaining those systems, some of them are on-premise systems. And thirdly, cost associated with administering those disparate systems, you get no economies of scale with regard to administrative capability when you have so many different systems in place by business unit and by region.On the flip slide, you also have a business case around improved compliance, better reporting, because you can centralize reporting globally, as well as better content reuse, faster adoption of e-learning and improved productivity of employees who have to meet some of these requirements, but can do so in a more homogeneous fashion and in a more global way, so all of those drive growth.The other aspect of this is what we call the extended enterprise, so a company like BP and many of our clients have not just a lot of employees, but also lot of contractors and distributors and vendors who also need to be trained on compliance requirements or product specifications, all that again being done through single system globally. So that’s the business case and it’s very compelling, we see that across the board.With regard to performance, this is another example of a client that was using SAP as the ERP system and SuccessFactors as the performance management system.Michael Huang – Needham & CompanyGot it. I think you made a comment that talk about the number of leads that you saw at HR Tech being double versus last year. But I was wondering, what ultimately is driving this type of traffic level and I don’t know if you want to compare that relative to your expectation kind of going into that event. And at the end of the day, like what’s the cross section there, are they larger ones, are they SMB, maybe you could just give us some color around that? Thanks.Adam MillerSo as you know, the HR Technology conference does not really attract SMB companies, so this is mostly mid-market and large enterprises. What we found, we expected an uptick, we didn’t necessarily expect it double, but we did expect to grow from the prior year. And we think that growth is due to the obvious reasons. Number one, we have an expanded product suite that is better meeting the needs of companies around talent management. The other is that we are the de facto best-of-breed solution in the market today and not only do we have continued interest in our existing solutions, but we knew the interest based on both the expansion of the suite and the fact that we are the leading best-of-breed provider with an organically built fully integrated talent management suite.Michael Huang – Needham & CompanyGot you, okay. And last question for you just kind of a follow up on Pat’s question around Workday, so if Workday goes into recruiting, as you look in your crystal ball, what’s more likely for you guys to go into core HR or for them to go into learning, just any thoughts around that?Adam MillerWorkday is a great partner and a great company. What I will say is that in this space and particularly amongst all of the cloud computing companies not just within talent management, but broadly you are going to see increasing levels of coopetition. Many of us are working together, but many of us also on the margins or the fringes compete and it’s just part of the game. We are all getting quite good at it. We have a lot of co-coopetition amongst many of our alliance partners and that’s true with cloud companies in general, as well as other consulting and payroll type companies as well.And I think you are going to see more of that over time, but you’ll also see the leading vendors in each of the cloud application verticals get better at that level of coopetition, eliminate the channel management within their – the channel conflict within their sales organizations and enable more growth across the board.Michael Huang – Needham & CompanyThank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question is from Rick Sherlund of Nomura. Your line is open.Rick Sherlund – Nomura ResearchYeah, thanks, terrific quarter.Adam MillerThank you.Rick Sherlund – Nomura ResearchI want to - first some clarification, can you hear me now.Adam MillerYes.Rick Sherlund – Nomura ResearchOkay. First I wondered if you could just offer some clarification. The 78% increase in billings growth, you’d alluded to effective some change in terms. Can you just go back over that again, what would the growth rate would have been, have there been consistent terms year-over-year?Adam MillerYeah, basically the color that we gave was that we forecast billing a specific percentage of the first-year software and services, and in the quarter we billed a little bit better than the normal percentage. And so, if we had billed the normal percentage, we were looking at something like a 73% growth rate rather than a 78% growth rate.Rick Sherlund – Nomura ResearchGot it, okay. And I’m kind of curious with this whole fiscal cliff issue it sounds like it’s not been an issue for you. We’ve got Sandy to worry to about. It sounds like, Hurricane Sandy. I don’t know if you have any thoughts on if that was at all a negative impact on your business in the quarter?Adam MillerI mean, the only impact was that it delayed sales cycles by a week. Fortunately it happened early in the quarter. If it happened in the last week of the quarter, it could have been real trouble for us. But given when it happened, we’ve seen no impact.Rick Sherlund – Nomura ResearchOkay, yeah. So, yeah, your September quarter, and then lastly, in terms of sales people, where are you getting them from, kind of what’s your perception of what’s going on at SAP and Oracle and why are you seeing them seemingly kind of dropping a ball in the segment of the market?Adam MillerYeah, we don’t like to speak badly about the competition. What I would say is that companies like SAP and Oracle have very large installed bases and a very large product base. Talent management for them represents less than for each of them, less than 1% of their business. So as they both struggle to move into cloud computing, their focus is not going to be on talent management. Their focus is obviously going to be more on their core products like financials and HRIS and supply chain management and CRM.As a result, we are solely focused on talent management. We have an organically built solution that’s fully integrated end-to-end around talent management and that gives us not just focus amongst our sales people and our service people, but also with regard to our relationship with the client base. And that’s given us the real competitive advantage, it’s not going away.Rick Sherlund – Nomura ResearchYeah, so Adam this pretty much is playing out as you expected them, the competition is just defocused?Adam MillerYeah, I would say, it’s playing out better than we expected.Rick Sherlund – Nomura ResearchYeah, okay, thanks.OperatorThank you. Next question is from Scott Berg of Northland Capital. Your line is open.Scott Berg – Northland Capital MarketsHi, Adam and Perry, really strong quarter here, I’ve got two quick ones. First one on the continued growth investments, I assume a lot of that will come in sales head count going forward. How should we look at those addition of sales head people, should we look at kind of a similar type of growth as the last two years have seen in terms of the doubling of your (inaudible) sales force or do expect that to be maybe accelerate or taper off?Adam MillerSo we haven’t announced our specific plans around the growth, but you could expect us to remain aggressive. Just like this past year, we do not grow linearly across each team rather we grow globally across all segments and all business lines, and we will continue to do that into this year. I would also say that we think about our business as a three legged stool and we want to make sure as we always do that we have proportionality between sales, services, and technology and so you will see us make investments in all three areas, not one at the expense of another.Scott Berg – Northland Capital MarketsAll right, great. And then the last question is, is there any change maybe coming off of HR Tech, or anything else that you saw yourself in the quarter in how customers are purchasing products maybe that a number of customers are trying to bundle together maybe the learning plus the performance suite or maybe a few customers bundling together the recruiting suite or is that number kind of in line with your recent - over the last couple of quarters?Adam MillerWell, I would say over the last year, we’ve seen that number climb off and specifically we’ve seen over 50% of our clients find two or more of our clouds upfront, out of the four clouds that we have. And that number seems to be increasing. We’re also as we always have continuing to see clients who are using the product over time adapt more and more of the functionality. So irrespective of if they start with performance or succession or learning over time they’re adding more of the functionality and we expect to see the same thing with recruiting over time.Scott Berg – Northland Capital MarketsGreat, I’ll jump back into the queue. Thank you.Adam MillerThank you.Perry WallackThanks.OperatorThank you. We have time for one more question. Our next question is from Justin Furby, William Blair. Your line is open.Justin Furby – William Blair & CompanyHi guys. This is Justin in for Laura. Thanks for the question, and congrats on another solid quarter. I guess Perry, is there any way that you could frame up the kind of ASP growth that you’re seeing both on the enterprise and mid market and whether it’s year-on-year or sequential. I mean it looks like the number of clients that you added was very similar to what you did last quarter you had obviously real strong bookings performance relative to Q2. So any additional color there would be helpful?Perry WallackI mean look obviously when you just do the straight math and you look at the number of customers and the bookings that would indicate that we’re just doing more and more big deals. So I think that we’re probably on the margins expanding ASPs, but we’re just doing more of them and so that way it looks like the averages are going up.The only other thing that I would deal with that to what Adam said which is the trend for customers to buy more than one of our clouds, continues to increase.Justin Furby – William Blair & CompanyOkay. And then I guess on the competitive front, specific to Workday, when you guys are in deal cycles and performance management is sort of the key area or driving the bus in the deal cycle, why might you win in those deals versus Workday and why might you lose, and then any sort of win or loss rates that you could share would be helpful?Adam MillerLet me reiterate for the fourth time that Workday is a partner, not a competitor. If it is a performance only deal or learning and performance deal, in other words if it’s a talent management deal then Cornerstone will compete for the business, Workday typically will not. If it’s a human capital management deal or an HRIS system and it includes performance then Workday will compete for that deal and we typically will not.So the only time you have overlap is if they’re looking for both and usually it depends on who brought the other into the deal. We’ll usually sell those deals together and depending on the client situation and timing of who had the relationship when, it will determine who gets the performance piece. But more often than not we’re not competing over that business.Justin Furby – William Blair & CompanyOkay. And then maybe lastly on the services restructuring or some of the changes, can you just give a quick high level of what you did to change it and how that’s improved your customer set?Adam MillerYeah, I say we’ve done three things. Number one, we’ve simply added more people as our client base grows, we want to make sure that we’re continuing to invest not only in sales, but also in service and technology to make sure we have the right ratios in place. Number two, we’ve realigned our global products [for team] [ph] to allow for better work stream management around the different types of cases that they receive on a daily basis.And number three, we have continued to invest heavily in our Client Success Management function, which provides an overlay of solution optimization experts to focus on client utilization, engagement, satisfaction and we’ve been able to do that even with our existing margin profile because of the growth of the business. And so all of that drives higher levels of client satisfaction, and improve client success, which is one of our core tenets.And what I will say is we are doing that at a time when our competitors are doing the exact opposite. They’re outsourcing more and more of their services and they’re essentially getting out of the business of servicing their clients, leading to dissatisfaction and lower quality of service levels. So not only are we making improvements in distancing ourselves from the competition from a product standpoint, but we’re also doing it from a service standpoint.Justin Furby – William Blair & CompanyAnd Adam, when you say they’re outsourcing their services, what exactly are you getting at there?Adam MillerFor example some of the competitors are no longer paying their sales reps on service revenue, which leads the reps to automatically look for the lowest cost service provider, which might be good for the rep, but not necessarily good for the client.Justin Furby – William Blair & CompanyOkay. Okay, great. Thanks for the questions. I appreciate it.Adam MillerThank you.OperatorThank you. This ends the Q&A portion of today’s conference. I’d like to turn the call over to the President and CEO, Adam Miller. Please continue.Adam MillerThank you all for your time, and for your questions. And we are looking forward to continuing to grow the business, and empowering people. Thank you all.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today’s conference.

            "from the line of Mark Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.Mark Murphy – Piper JaffrayYes. Thank you and congrats on a strong year. Perry, I wanted to ask you, there’s a noticeable spike in the deferred commissions on the balance sheet, seems a bit unusual. Wondering if you could please explain the underlying dynamic there? Was there some kind of a change in the comp plans? Was there a change in the timing of the payouts? Or maybe something else going on?Perry WallackNo. We have a little bit of a difference in a payment term for our internal sales force, where there’s different cut-off dates for the end of the year for sales commissions, but I don’t think it’s really that material and whatever spike you saw will be flushed in Q1.Mark Murphy – Piper JaffrayThank you. As a follow-up, Adam, I wanted to ask you a question regarding competitor pricing out there in the marketplace. Based on some of our field checks, we have heard indications of, I guess I’d say, desperation pricing or at a minimum unnaturally low pricing in certain cases, out of SuccessFactors specifically, and I’m just wondering if that’s anything you’ve observed? And if so, maybe what do you read into that behavior or what do you think is behind it?Adam MillerYeah, I mean, it definitely is deal-by-deal, so it’s very deal specific. We do see high variability. I think it has to do with which teams are working on particular deals, but we have seen some unnatural pricing as you’re describing. I think it’s temporary, we’ve seen it before, tends to happen towards the end of the year, as people are trying to hit numbers, and I do not think it’s a widespread change.Mark Murphy – Piper JaffrayAdam, I also wanted to ask you, in terms of Cornerstone for Salesforce, anything you can share with us in terms of how big you think that can be considering it’s something you’ve been working on in the background for a while, and that I think sales enablement and training is a pretty pervasive and pretty big need for a large number of companies?Adam MillerYeah, we certainly believe it’s a real opportunity for us. We clearly are seeing demand for it, and it fits in perfectly with our overall strategy around learning and talent management. With regard to the exact size, as you know we don’t breakout product sizing or our performance, but I will tell you that we think there is a big opportunity. Salesforce is obviously doing extremely well and therefore there are many, many corporate sales teams out there using salesforce.com and we think this gives us yet another competitive advantage over the competition.Mark Murphy – Piper JaffrayAnd, Adam, one last one if I may. Just considering the pipeline that you’ve got and the economic climate, however that feels to you entering 2013, what are your thoughts about just the prospects specifically for your new business bookings in the course of that year? Would you think that that would run at a fairly consistent level, maybe slightly better, or slightly worse? Again just specific to the new bookings portion of the total business.Adam MillerYeah I mean obviously I can’t comment on 2013 progress year-to-date, but I can tell you that we are feeling good about our position this year. We’ve seen very good momentum coming out of last year and we think the market opportunity continues to grow for us internationally.Mark Murphy – Piper JaffrayThank you.OperatorThank you, Mr. Murphy. Our next question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Rick Sherlund – NomuraYes, thank you. Good quarter. I wonder if you could talk about the pull through that you’re getting for the entire suite now, any metric you can give us in terms of how the other products might be attaching to learning?Adam MillerYeah, so as we’ve discussed on prior calls, we are seeing the real ability to sell through the entire suite as well as a significant percentage of our client base using more than learning; more than half of our client-base specifically uses two or more of our clouds. And only 85% of our client base is using learning today. About two-thirds – over 65% of our client base is using our performance cloud. So we are seeing a clear ability to cross sell. Early adoption of recruiting has been better than any of our other products released to-date, and we believe we’re at the beginning of what’s become a real trend around integrated talent management.Rick Sherlund – NomuraAnd I wonder if you could comment on any deal slip that at the end of the year you might have seen relating to concerns over the fiscal cliff or macro issues? Any material deal slippage that would be unusual in nature?Adam MillerI mean we definitely had deal slip in Q4. There definitely were concerns around the fiscal cliff, and we definitely saw some of the large clients delay their decisions. But a lot of those are back in play now. So I don’t think it was a significant impact; it was a temporary effect.Rick Sherlund – NomuraGreat. Thank you.OperatorThank you, Mr. Sherlund. Our next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead, your line is open.Brendan Barnicle – Pacific Crest SecuritiesGreat. Adam I just wanted to follow-up, you’ve had pretty consistent increase in customer count, but you’ve seen a nice increase in bookings. Can you give us any more color on what you’re seeing in terms of deal sizes or sort of ASPs in general?Adam MillerYeah, our deal size has continued to stay strong and has being going up across the board, both at the mid-market and with regard to enterprise. We think the market’s maturing overall. As we go further down market, our per seat pricing is significantly higher, because you don’t have the volume discounts, and as the market truly understands both the returns around talent management as well as the fact that there’s, number one less competition, and number two more product to sell for our reps, all of those are contributing to higher ASPs across the board.Brendan Barnicle – Pacific Crest SecuritiesAnd just following up a little on Mark Murphy’s question about SuccessFactors, what are you seeing out of Plateau in that acquisition that they did?Adam MillerWell, I think I talked about this two calls ago, which was to say that we though most of the talent at Plateau was leaving and I think that’s essentially complete. There are very few original Plateau people at the company. It’s one of the reasons that we’ve seen such strong performance out of our public sector team, which left a big opportunity for us, and it’s one of the reasons that we really are taking a very dominant position in learning at this point.Brendan Barnicle – Pacific Crest SecuritiesGreat. And then, Perry, I had a couple of quick ones for you. Any more color on Q1 earnings?Perry WallackNo, we don’t give guidance on a quarterly basis except for revenue. So we have not done that since we went public and we’re not going to change that process for this year. We’ve guided to Q1 revenue, full year revenue, full year non-GAAP cash flow from operations and full year EPS.OperatorThank you Mr. Barnicle. Our next question comes from Laura Lederman with William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Laura Lederman – William BlairYes, thank you for taking my questions. Can you give us a little bit of an update on the government and how the pipeline looks there and how business did in 2012? And also can you talk a little bit about, outside of government, just large sales in general and what you’re seeing?Adam MillerSure. So with regard to public sector specifically, we really think about public sector today as four separate verticals: Federal, state local, Higher Ed, and K-12, and we see aggressive growth opportunities in all four verticals. So obviously the main deal in the U.S. government was initially the treasury like the purchase agreement we had and most recently in Q4, our deal with HUD.We are seeing a lot of client acquisition in Higher Ed specifically. We’ve had significant growth in the Higher Ed space including USC amongst many others and that’s both direct and indirectly with regard to our partnership with Lucien.We’re seeing opportunities in K-12 that I think are earlier than we expected to see; we thought it would take a while to build out that segment of the market, and we’re seeing early opportunity there. And with regard to state local, most notably we just closed the State of North Carolina but we’re seeing opportunity at the state, county and municipal level. So we’re growing all those teams fairly aggressively.In addition to that, with regard to just large enterprise deals generally, we are seeing a lot of large enterprise deals in play. Last year obviously we quoted some big ones like Tyco and others. There are many other: BP, BMW and some that we’re not allowed to mention, but you could probably figure out. There are others that are in play right now. And so we are seeing more activity in what we consider strategic accounts than we’ve seen before. And as a result we’ve been building out a dedicated strategic accounts team.Laura Lederman – William BlairCan you talk a little bit about the kind of average price you’re seeing for recruiting and where that has been falling? And is it changing in terms of since you announced the product?Adam MillerYeah, we think about the three sort of core clouds learning, performance, and recruiting as equivalent. And so, they’re basically priced the same. We want a rep selling what the – we want our sales teams selling what the client needs, not what’s going to garner potentially higher commission. And as a result, there is no advantage to a sales person at Cornerstone selling one cloud over another; they’re essentially equivalent.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Dunham with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Frank Robinson – Goldman SachsHi, yeah it’s Frank Robinson here for Greg. Good quarter guys.Adam MillerThank you.Frank Robinson – Goldman SachsI wanted to ask, I guess you doubled your head count in both 2011 and 2012. Can you like sort of talk about what you expect to add percent wise on in 2013? And also maybe touch on what percent of the business is coming from alliances?Perry WallackYeah, so we really don’t detail out exact numbers of head count in the different departments. If you’re trying to drill into something right around sales head count, we don’t give that detail. Our standard metric is roughly a third of the company is in sales and marketing, and they’re not all quota carrying reps. One of the other pieces of color that we often give is when we grow our sales force, we don’t necessarily grow our sales force linearly from year-to-year. So in other words, if we grow our enterprise sales team at a certain rate in 2012, that team is not going to grow at that same rate in 2013. So I think that answers your first question.And your second, could you repeat that?Frank Robinson – Goldman SachsSecond question was just what percent of business is coming from alliances or partnerships?Adam MillerYeah. So about 10% of our – I’m sorry, about 20% of our incremental sales come from alliances and that’s been pretty consistent over the last couple of years. What’s changed is the mix of those alliance partners and what the sources are of the agreements that we’re making. But what I will say is that, as a percentage of total incremental bookings, it’s been very consistent. And our goal has been to diversify our partner mix so that we don’t have too much concentration with any single partner, but maintain that 20% in direct sales count.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please go ahead, your line is open.Brent Thill – UBSThanks. Adam, on your comment on the recruiting component becoming – putting the finishing touches on by March, can you just give us a sense of what this gives you now once you get past March? Are you completely where you want to be on the recruiting side?And I guess secondarily for Perry, when you look at the guidance you’ve given this year, have you factored in a lot of recruiting or is this mainly coming from the other clouds?Adam MillerWhat I would tell you is that with regard to the roadmap for recruiting, we’ve learned a long time ago that the roadmap never ends. We obviously have been building learning for a very long time and that roadmap is still very robust. We expect the same thing to happen in recruiting. We have a very detailed roadmap that takes us out over quite some time. So we’re going to keep building out capabilities. The point we were making is that, by March, we have both an enterprise class ATS and a state-of-the-art social recruiting platform that was organically built and that has no rival in the market from a product standpoint.Perry WallackSure. And then as far as guidance goes, you know, we don’t give necessarily specific guidance on our different products and our different revenue streams. What I would just highlight is we’ve I think proven to be sort of conservative from the last couple of years and we tend to be conservative, and so we don’t like to over-promise and under-deliver. And we’re looking forward to selling a lot of this, this year, and we will look forward to giving you updates on that progress throughout the year.Brent Thill – UBSThanks, Perry.OperatorThank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Mike Nemeroff – Credit SuisseHey guys, thanks for taking my questions and a very nice 2012. I didn’t hear you mention the number of million-dollar deals. I was wondering if you’ve given that or if you could give that?Adam MillerWe’ve never given that statistic. It’s been consistently growing since inception and it’s still growing, so. We’re seeing more larger deals than we’ve seen before both in 2012 and in the pipeline.Mike Nemeroff – Credit SuisseThanks, Adam. And then Perry, I don’t know if you mentioned it, but the geographic breakdown? And if Adam you could comment on the particular geographies, where you saw some of the more – bigger areas of strength in Q4?Adam MillerYeah, I would say generally about 30% of our revenue is coming internationally. Most of that is coming from EMEA, but we do see opportunity in all regional markets. The product today is in use in 186 countries in 42 languages, so we’re seeing the opportunity to sell around the world. And we’re seeing growth both domestically and internationally in the 60% range. So I would tell you that most of that 30% is coming from EMEA today, but we are starting to build out teams in both APAC and Latin America, where we believe there is significant dormant opportunity right now.OperatorThank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Berg with Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Scott Berg – Northland Capital MarketsHi, Adam and Perry, nice quarter here, congratulations.Adam MillerThank you.Scott Berg – Northland Capital MarketsCan you talk about attrition in the quarter: was anything different in terms of customer losses relative to the rest of the year?Adam MillerNo, there was nothing substantial. In fact, we had what I would describe as one save where we thought we were going to lose a customer and we actually were able to retain them. Nothing unusual, we’ve stayed in the mid-90%s. As Perry mentioned we believe that as we go further and further down market, it’s going to be harder and harder to retain that 95% exactly, but we are right around that range and we’ve stayed in the mid-90%s, and we expect to stay there.Scott Berg – Northland Capital MarketsGreat. And I guess my last question Adam is around growth investments for the year. You guys are obviously very bullish on the environment and it sounds like you’re going to continuing to invest heavily. But from an optics perspective, do you see more of them falling in the first half of the year versus second half of the year or is it pretty consistent and linear to what you’ve invested in the last couple of years? Thank you.Adam MillerSo as I’ve mentioned in the past, we try to be very disciplined in our growth, and as a result we believe we understand that what level of hiring we can effectively on-board, and we’ve tried to be very consistent about our hiring plans, about the growth of our teams, about the on boarding processes that we follow, including the use of our own product internally. And that’s enabled us to not just continuously grow our sales teams, but never have to have a layoff and be able to have optimal productivity of the reps early in their careers. So, you’ll see it fairly consistent throughout the year, it won’t be all upfront.OperatorThank you. And it appears we have time for one final questioner. Our final questions come from the line of Michael Huang with Needham & Company. Please go ahead, your line is now open.Michael Huang – Needham & CompanyThanks so much. Just a couple quick ones for you guys. So first of all, in terms of the Cornerstone for Salesforce offering, I was wondering if you could share how it’s priced and how it’s being sold? And then more importantly I was wondering do you see this as an opportunity to up sell these customers to the core Cornerstone suite over time. How should we be thinking about that? Thanks.Adam MillerWe really – as you know, Michael we often will do enterprise-wide ideals; that’s our typical deal is enterprise wide. We believe that this will be a supplemental increase to our deals specifically for the Salesforce. Now, there will be cases where we’ll go in salesforce.com and that has been the case with some of the deals we’ve already done, in which case we will work with them, with the tools and solutions that they have, and that could lead to up sell opportunities down the road. But initially those deals would be primarily Cornerstone for Salesforce combined with work.com and chatter for example.Michael Huang – Needham & CompanyOkay. So, the Salesforce sales reps, are they getting any quota credit for this at all?Adam MillerThere is a portion of it where – and I don’t want to get too detailed in the Salesforce economics, but obviously you need a platform license and the reps are getting credit for the platform license. They’re not getting full credit for CFS but they’re getting the platform component of that deal.Michael Huang – Needham & CompanyOkay. And then last question for you. So, in terms of kind of how you see competition trending through this year, obviously very favorable landscape for you guys. But when you’re – what are your assumptions around Oracle and SAP kind of through this year? Do you expect them to get their act together relative to last year? Or what would be kind of your view baked within your guidance? Thanks.Adam MillerI mean my view is that Oracle is going to become less and less relevant in this industry over time. They have a weaker solution, they are obviously focused on lots of different areas including things like CRM and marketing automation and have less focus on talent management specifically. SAP, it remains to be seen what they do with SuccessFactors and the level of independence they’re going to give SuccessFactors. Right now, they’re a more credible competitor, but depending on what moves they make, that could change as well. So, I’m very optimistic about the competitive landscape. Obviously, there’s also competition in our space but we’ve learned to live with that and I think we’re comfortable with our partnerships and the opportunities we have ahead of us.Michael Huang – Needham & CompanyAwesome. Thanks guys.Adam MillerHugh we can take two more questions as well.OperatorOkay. (Operator Instructions) Presenters, there appears to be no additional questioners in the phone queue at this time. I’d like to turn the program back over to Mr. Miller.Adam MillerGreat, thank you all for your participation and we look forward to speaking again soon. Thank you.Perry WallackYes, thank you everybody.OperatorThank you, presenters. Again ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. Attendees, you may log off at this time.")
# 2013 q1
csod.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Greg Dunham"
            " of Goldman Sachs.Greg Dunham – Goldman SachsYes, thanks for taking my question, another 50% bookings quarters and acceleration from Q4, you highlighted in Q4 that in December that you saw some weakness towards the end of the quarter really due to timing application and I guess what may be some people want is ready for us does Easter came at the end of Q1. How does the quarter progressed from a linearity perspective for you this time around?Adam L. MillerWe were able to bringing the deals that it got flipped last quarter, so we did close the deals that we said close from last quarter and then with regard to this quarter, we did have our more typical late quarter seasonality where more the deals close towards the very end of the quarter, which is unfortunately typical for us.Greg Dunham – Goldman SachsNow that make sense and I guess any commentary and in terms of the user count and the customer count was high but also in terms of this ASP and deals, what do you see in from pricing dynamic and the large deal activity. Thank you.Adam L. MillerSo we are definitely seeing an increase in ASPs, we are seeing that both with regard to that the price per module or individual product within the cloud, as well as the price for each individual client and that’s due to our ability to sell more product in more of the suite in the initial deal. So both things are driving our pricing and ASP in particular.Greg Dunham – Goldman SachsGreat. Thanks guys.Adam L. MillerThanks, Greg.OperatorAnd we will take our next question from Mark Murphy of Piper Jaffray.Mark Murphy – Piper JaffrayYes. Thank you. Adam, your bookings growth accelerated against a tougher comparison and you’re showing about 10 points of margin improvement year-over-year. So it’s – you’re in sort of an area in terms of the growth and a leverage combination. And I’m just wondering do you have any inclination to hire incrementally, any more aggressively or invested any differently on that basis?Adam L. MillerSo, we are doing that and you’ll notice in Perry’s comment, he talked about the fact that tour cash flow targets are not changing even though we’re beating revenue. And part of the reason for that is we want to reinvest the overachievement back into the business, so to foster continued growth. But what we’re not doing is we are not changing our commentary around our path to profitability. We think we are in a very clear path to profitability and even with the acceleration in hiring, because of the overachievement, we in effect, can afford it and it doesn’t impact our long-term profitability objectives.Mark Murphy – Piper JaffrayAnd then, I wanted to ask you as well, Adam, what do you think is the appetite for customers to bite off some big chunks of your recruiting product after the major release comes out? I think you have one coming out in another month or two. And within that, are you seeing any standalone recruiting opportunities, or is it – do you think it’s generally all going to be some add-on transactions.Adam L. MillerJoe, I’ll tell you that out of the gate we’re seeing many more full suite deals and we expected, meaning recruiting, learning, and performance all at once upfront and we’re seeing that both in the enterprise and in the middle market. With regard to recruiting on a standalone basis, we’ve been pretty consistent without this. We believe starting in the second half of this year; we will be competitive on a standalone basis in recruiting. And we are waiting for our June release, our spring release, which will get us to the level of competitiveness that we need and then the release is beyond that take us further and further away from the competition, I’m sorry ahead of the competition.Mark Murphy – Piper JaffrayGot it, got it, one last one Adam. How would you characterize the deal pipeline in aggregate here as you enter Q2, just given the strong trends that you described? I am wondering how the pipeline measures up versus your expectations maybe in terms of just overall visibility, coverage ratio, so on and so forth?Adam L. MillerWell, the attorneys' never like when I talk about pipelines, but I will say that we are very comfortable with where our pipelines are now, especially relative to last year or the year before, both in terms of in absolute basis, as well on a relative basis.Mark Murphy – Piper JaffrayThank you very much.Adam L. MillerThank you.OperatorAnd we will take our next question from Rick Sherlund of Nomura.Richard Sherlund – NomuraThanks. First for Adam on the dynamics and the competition with Taleo and success factors. Can you kind of update us on what you might have seen in terms of any change in competitive dynamics in the markets?Adam L. MillerYeah, we’re seeing less and less of Taleo. It’s been almost fully absorbed into Oracle, and by that I mean most of the people from the former Taleo organization of the left and have gone on to other organizations, often outside the industry.SAP or specifically SuccessFactors still remains competitive and is still operating on a relatively independent basis, but we believe at some point that will change as their force to integrate audit because of the incremental acquisition in SAP mix were just a demand to the industry in what they’re doing. So in both cases they’ve been certainly distracted and we have been hard at work on all roadmap on the growth of our distribution capability and I think Convergence, our user conference in June, people are going to see the very tangible advances we’ve made across the product line.Richard Sherlund – NomuraOkay and we’ve heard about user interface improvement, is there anything else you can elaborate on in terms of the improvements on the products side?Adam L. MillerYeah, user interface improvements probably be understanding it, we are doing a full overhaul of our user experience and we spend a lot of time thinking about the consumerization of the enterprise and what that means in our industry and for us in particular and we are launching a much more streamlined experience for end users, which we think will drive engagement and further adoption of the solution.Richard Sherlund – NomuraOkay, and Perry, just a question for you on G&A, it was about a million (inaudible) than we thought you mentioned there were increased levels, has that been a sustainable level that we saw in Q1?Perry A. WallackNo, we should see leverage in G&A throughout the remaining quarters of the year. When we look at total G&A for the full year, we should see at least the point or two of leverage over the prior year. So, Q1 a little bit of an anomaly.Richard Sherlund – NomuraAnd cash flow – the receivables actually look fine to me, it was more of an anomalous things where your accrued expenses are less than we thought, prepaids are more than we thought. I would think that’s all stuff that kind of washes out in the next quarter.Adam L. MillerYeah, that’s right. I mean, we had – if you recall, we had just little bit of a change in our commission plan that we implemented in Q4, and so you’ll see a little bit of anomalies in those things running through the financials until Q4 of this year, when we’ve got four steady quarters of it.Richard Sherlund – NomuraGreat. Okay, thank you.OperatorAnd we will take our next question from Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse.Michael Anderson – Credit SuisseHi, this is Mike Anderson on behalf of Michael, thanks for taking our questions. First one is just, can you just give us an update on how the small business is progressing with you guys and your small business segment?Perry A. WallackYeah. So, we’ll tell you, last quarter, or specifically in Q4, it started to show a little more than what we would have liked. In Q4, it corrected back to the levels of growth we want to see and we are now seeing very good productivity across the Board on our small business sales team and we’re going to continue to expand the size of that team.Michael Anderson – Credit SuisseOkay, great. And just, can you also give us an update on how the launch of Cornerstone for Salesforce went in the quarter, seeing it’s still relatively new product?Perry A. WallackYeah. So, it’s real to be new from the perspective of when we officially launched it, but the product has been around for a little bit now and we are close to 70 clients today for that product in growing. It is also moving up the ranks in the Force.com world and it is now one of the top applications in the app exchange environment, and we are continuing to move off and starting to work more closely with Salesforce, and we need to make sure that we continue to dominate that side of the Force.com world, specifically in earnings.Michael Anderson – Credit SuisseGreat, thanks for taking my questions and nice quarter.Perry A. WallackThank you.Adam L. MillerThank you.OperatorAnd we will take our next question from Justin Furby of William Blair.Justin Furby – William BlairHey guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. Adam, I was hoping you might be able to walk through a little bit of the dynamics that you’re seeing and how the large enterprise and mid-market might differentiate both from a competitive standpoint? And then which one is growing faster and where do you plan to add more sales capacity going forward between those two markets?Perry A. WallackSo you want to seek a recipe to how we do grow. Here is what I’ll tell you. We are seeing good growth in both markets. We’re seeing ASPs increase in both segments. We are seeing competition differ in the two segments, they always have, but it’s become more different. In the enterprise segment, we’re clearly competing now with SAP and Oracle. The primary difference which I’ve talked about on prior calls is that whereas in the past we competed full with success factors and Taleo and every individual deal.Now, we’re competing often with one or the other. If it’s an SAP shop, we’re obviously competing with them. If it’s an Oracle shop, we’re competing with Oracle Taleo, but they are not showing up at each others incumbent counts. And so our competition at the deal levels has been cut effectively by 50% and that’s helped us to increase our win rates.In the mid market space, it’s been more dramatic. As you all know when you go to down market particularly in the small end of mid-market we’re in the SMB space. Oracle and SAP do not pull well. And we are not seeing them competing in that segment anymore, not really as effectively at least. So there is much less competition there we’re also leveraging more distributors and we’re seeing a lot of opportunity but in both cases, we are seeing the same positioning of the company which is best-of-breed versus ERP suite and we believe we are now the only enterprise class best-of-breed player in the market everybody else we compete with is a general, we are the only talent management specialist and that is giving us a real advantage in the marketplace.Justin Furby – William BlairOkay and then when you look on the product side obviously you got a big build-out on the recruiting side and you mentioned some of the UI overhauls, what I guess outside those things, what’s the next logical thing that the customers are asking for and then separately I know your position has always been on the HRIS side to more stay away from that and integrate but do you – how often do you go into deals where that ends up costing you, will there ever be a change down the road where you might look to build that functionality yourself?Perry A. WallackNo. Let me answer the second question first because of our partnerships, we’re not really excluded from those deals, we’re just going in with partners on those deals, but for example it works.Justin Furby – William BlairOkay.Perry A. WallackIn the case of the former question we’ll talk about this a lot more on our next call which will been a focus on the product but I will say that we see a lot of opportunity and what I call actionable social networking and so we are – we launching Connect at our client conference in June and will talk a lot more about that at our next call, but we are really trying to capture the benefits of social networking as it relates to do any things like project and managing teams and collaborating with other people and development for the purposes of development, so that is really the next area for us.Justin Furby – William BlairGreat. And then just one last one, on the – you mentioned the greater inventories in multi- clouds deals, if you look at the deals specific to this quarter, can you give us any specifics around what percentage – 50% of you entire installed base has two or more clouds. What does the deals look like in Q1, is it a much larger number than the 50%?Adam L. MillerYes, it is higher. I don't have the exact number, it is higher than 50%. So what's happening is that number is trending up across the installed base both because we're upselling older accounts, accounts that have been with us for a longer period of time, who may have only had one cloud when they first purchased Cornerstone and we are continuing to drive new sales that are cross sold with multiple products. And more of the new sales, more than 50% of the new sales included two or more clouds. And as I said before, we are seeing more and more often people buying the entire suite upfront.Justin Furby – William BlairAwesome, thanks, guys. Great quarter.Adam L. MillerThank you.OperatorAnd we will taker our next question from Brent Thill with UBS.John S. Byun – UBS Securities LLCHi, this is John Byun for Brent Thill. Could you give a little bit of color around the international markets and give us the mix if you can and then also (inaudible) if you could provide a headcount that would be great. Thank you.Adam L. MillerSo we don't give our headcount number specifically, but what I will tell you is that internationals represent about 30% of revenue in similar number of incremental sales, similar percentage. We think that number will increase. We are just now starting to expand our operations into Asia Pacific and Latin America, both of which, we think will drive incremental growth on top of what we're already seeing in EMEA. So we think that 30% will continue to increase. Within EMEA, most of that revenue obviously coming from Europe and within Europe, it’s relatively split between the U.K., the Nordics, Central Europe and Southern Europe. So it is fairly diversified throughout Europe, it’s not concentrated in anyone area.John S. Byun – UBS Securities LLCThank you.OperatorAnd we will take our next question from Michael Huang, Needham & Co.Michael Huang - Needham & Co.Thanks very much. Just a couple of quick ones for you guys. So in terms of the partnership with Workday, I was wondering if you would comment on how that relationship is trending. I don’t know if you can characterize or qualify whether or not number of wins that you guys are selling jointly is picking up and growing, that would be helpful. And then more of a higher level one, as you think about the partner ecosystem, I was wondering if I could get you to comment on which partner you saw would be more important for you guys longer-term, Workday or Saleforce, which partnership has more upside of the longer-term? Thanks.Adam L. MillerYeah, once you get into a very long philosophical debate about partners in general, what I will say is that specifically, our partner’s strategy is one of avoiding concentration. So in much of a same way, that as a company we saw it very early on to avoid customer concentration, having too much of our revenue being associated with a single coin. We are actively avoiding partner concentration. So we’re making sure that not too much of our sales revenue is coming from any one or group of partners. And therefore, our strategy is one of diversification and we continue to do that. We are seeing a continued good relationship with Workday.On a relative basis, I think it’s been relatively consistent, but on in absolute basis, the numbers are going up. And I think that trend will continue as both of us continue to increase distribution globally. We’re the interesting things of that relationship or aspects of that relationship is that it’s not limited to the U.S. It is very much a global relationship. We are very complimentary sales teams around the world and we’re building opportunities to sell our products globally. For example, Cornerstone is in news today in 189 countries and in over 40 languages. So we’re seeing real opportunity to sell around the world and I think you’re going to see more and more of that from the other major cloud providers.Michael Huang - Needham & Co.Got you. Now, I think in one of the earlier answers to the question, you alluded to improving sales productivity around the small business and I guess that would be the Sonar product. So I was wondering what’s actually driving that. Like what’s helping you kind of derive the productivity and the sales activity there? ThanksPerry A. WallackWell, I think it’s taking time for the Cornerstone sales philosophy and process to get embedded into the company we have acquired, but it is now happened. And I’d say, as a business, Cornerstone has been very good at sales enablement. It’s one of the things we proud of ourselves on. On-boarding sales reps being very efficient about how we train to manage our sales teams and we’ve taken that same discipline and applied it to the small business teams, which is now resulted in very consistent performance across the boards.Michael Huang - Needham & Co.Great, thanks so much.OperatorAnd we will take our next question from Scott Berg of Northland Capital Markets.Scott Berg – Northland Capital MarketsHi, Adam and Perry, very good quarter here, congrats. I have two questions, I guess, the first one is combined question. Adam, can you talk about the demand for which products your state and local customers, or maybe government and education as a whole are currently seeking return of their disproportion between maybe learning and something the performance or successionary let’s say?Adam L. MillerYeah. I would say, it’s one area where recruiting is very important, those real demand for recruiting in the public sector, particularly at the state and local level as well as in Higher Ed. In [Q 2012] it’s been more about learning in the federal government, it’s been about performance and succession and in state and local, it’s been a combination of, I would say, all areas.It depends on the size of the deal or the area whether you’re talking about the state level, the county level, or the city level, or even a specific municipality, it will vary as to whether it’s about succession, or performance, or learning, or recruiting, but all of those would play. And in Higher Ed, it’s also been a combination, I would say, predominantly of learning and recruiting.Scott Berg – Northland Capital MarketsGreat. And then my last question is, it’s a competitive question, but SumTotal, obviously one of the legacy elements that is in the space with the large install base has went on a huge hiring the sales people over the last six months, especially for company that didn’t seem to be aggressive at all in terms of new sales since their acquisition. Are you seeing them at all in terms of new deals or seeing them more competitively at all?Adam L. MillerNo. I’d say they are probably more down market, we do not, it would be nice, we do not view them as a major competitive threat. Let me put it carefully that way.Scott Berg – Northland Capital MarketsGreat. That’s all I have. I’ll jump in the queue. Thanks and congrats guys.Adam L. MillerThank you.OperatorAnd this does conclude today’s question-and-answer session. At this time I will turn the call back to Adam Miller for closing remarks.Adam L. MillerGreat, I want to thank you all for your participation and we look forward to continued success. Thank you all.OperatorAnd this does conclude today’s conference call. Once again we would like to thank everyone for your participation and have a wonderful day.")
# 2013 q2
csod.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorYes, thank you. (Operator Instructions) And will go first to Mark Murphy"
            " with Piper Jaffray.Mark R. Murphy – Piper Jaffray, Inc.Yes, thank you and congratulations on the revenue and billings, acceleration here in Q2. Adam, I wanted to start by asking you, you’ve spoken in the past about an opportunity of approximately $400 million potential global feeds. And it looks like Cornerstone has over $13 million of them and I think $350 million are still up for grab, it is a Greenfield opportunity. The question is should we be thinking of those $400 million feeds as a static number or is that more of a moving target. When you think through population growth, more knowledge workers, more internet connectivity, more mobility et cetera, do you think that that’s something that’s over time is going to develop into something more a like $500 million feed opportunity?Perry WallackYeah, or more. I think all of the things you described are correct. You also can take into account that would be extended enterprise model. In some cases we could hit the exact same person from multiple places both where you work maybe where you go to school and perhaps based some other non-linear extrapolation of how you’re associating. So, trade associations at your end, places that you take training or generally gather a partner.So we think there is upside for that number, but it the same time we think, if you just focus on $300 million which is what we think is a very defensible number, and a very clear aspirational target for us. If we were to maintain even in our current market share, we are looking at 6 times growth of the business and we think we’re gaining market share.Mark R. Murphy – Piper Jaffray, Inc.And Adam, as a follow-up, I’m curious about the pricing dynamic. We feel like we have seen evidence of surprisingly from pricing for Cornerstone even in some of the largest take-offs, across all of the partner interviews that we do. And so I am wondering if you were to consider what a typical customer is paying to subscribe to your product suite and then you compare that to their annual spend on all of the employee labor within the business, how do you think that looks? In other words, what are they spending to optimizing all that labor expense and could that math actually argue for a price increase in terms of list prices, at some point especially while you have the competitive landscape here apparently in disarray?Adam L. MillerMark, I can answer that question so many different ways. Let me start by saying that Cornerstone typically cause give or take the cost of lunch for an employee. So we are talking about really a true fraction of their expense obviously depends on what type of worker, what industry they are in and what their pay package is overall, but generally are expense relative to the payroll spread is minute, we are talking about basis points, not percentages.The other factor here is that our industry overall and I am talking about talent management in general had started from very low price points. So when I walk around the floor of Dreamforce for example, and look at the ecosystem at Salesforce.com with many new cloud vendors emerging, using very point things in that case in the sales area, they are charging multiples of what we charge for our suite. In many cases, they are charging per month when we are charging per year. And as a result, I think there is lot’s of opportunity to keep growing price points particular as the competition shrinks as we move down market and there is more of a Greenfield opportunity and as we expand our product footprint to include more products upfront.And for all those things that we’re seeing here, a piece go up and I think as we have more and more proof of the kind of business impact that the Talent Management Solution offers, we’re going to also see the price points going up. But your research is correct, we have been holding fair amount of price and as a result, we become in many ways the premium provider in the space. Whereas I think a decade ago, we might a bit – we’re the lower cost providers.Mark R. Murphy – Piper Jaffray, Inc.I’m sorry. Go ahead.Perry WallackThere is definitely room for growth in ASPs and in price points proceeds. Definitely.Mark R. Murphy – Piper Jaffray, Inc.Thank you very much, Adam. If I may, a finally one, Perry. I wanted to ask you first off, is it possible just to ballpark maybe what percentage of bookings might have included recruiting in Q2 or is there anything material to speak of there? And then just on the topic of the magnitude of revenue upside it was – I’m surprised it’s sort of unusual and just based on your commentary, is that solely attributable to I guess, third-party services implementations or is there an element of subscription coming in above there as well?Adam L. MillerSo, as you know Mark, we don’t breakout what we sell by product lines. Our recruiting offering is still fairly new and so we’re just starting to sell that. So I think my commentary there would it was nothing of significant materiality in the quarter.In addition we don’t breakout our services versus our software revenue, we don’t give the detail on our bookings. What I can tell you is that from a services revenue standpoint, services revenues can and we talked about this before be a little bit lumpy based on either the size of the clients that are going live in any given quarter or the use of third-party implementation partners and us not being able to staff to the peak and needing to use partners for the flex that is required for those implementations. And so in any given quarter, we may see a little bit services revenue due to those factors.Mark R. Murphy – Piper Jaffray, Inc.Thank you very much.Adam L. MillerSure.OperatorAnd we’ll go next to Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse.Michael Nemeroff – Credit Suisse Securities, LLCHey guys thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to maybe ask about the International and how that trended in the quarter and what you are seeing over there in terms of momentum, hearing some signs of stabilization? And then also if I may just ask what’s your intended use of the cash that you raised with the convert? Thanks.Adam L. MillerFirst answer, is that international has trended consistent overtime. We’re in the very early days of Latin American and Asia-Pacific direct sales and services and we’ll talk more about that on our next call. But those markets are very nascent for us and still have not been a material contribution to overall results, but Europe and the rest of the world have been very consistent in growing parallel with the U.S. business.With regard to the convert, we saw an anomalous time in the market and a window of opportunity to take capital in a very modestly dilutive very cheap way in having been at the company, Bill, Perry and I from day one, we went a long time ago that you raised money when you can, not when you needed and we saw a very significant opportunity to be opportunistic with some essentially free capital and that’s exactly what we’ve done.So we have no near-term use, but we want to be opportunistic if over the course of the next five years, there’s acquisition opportunities or growth opportunities, where we need some excess capital that will be available to us.Michael Nemeroff – Credit Suisse Securities, LLCThanks for taking my questions, guys. I will get back in the queue.Unidentified Company RepresentativeThank you.Unidentified Company RepresentativeThank you.OperatorAnd we’ll go next to Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities.Brendan J. Barnicle – Pacific Crest Securities LLCThanks so much. Adam, you just saw this incredible increase in the user numbers and I know you talked about the ASP increases, but can you give us any more color on what drove that acceleration in user count? Is that more, product specific, more deal related, anything more you can give us on that would be helpful?Adam L. MillerSo the user count have been a little bit lumpy and the reason is, we don’t count users until they go live. And so depending on the timing of go lives and the mix between Extended Enterprise and our other clouds, you end up with different numbers at any given quarter, I would say that some of what you saw in Q2 was clients from the end of 2012 going live, you saw a little bit of that. So you have that because we’re very tight in how we count this. If you’ve gone live on April 1 EBIT, let’s say you close the deal, December 31 and you went live April 1, you would not be a part of that user count until Q2, until right now.I’d say that drives more than anything. The other is in addition, we’re going down market. We have been going up market. So we are doing more larger global deals with multinationals that have over 150,000 employees. So we now have many of those clients and those obviously create significant incremental pops to the user count.Brendan J. Barnicle – Pacific Crest Securities LLCPerfect. And Perry, I’m finding the guidance is a little bit of deceleration in the revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Now you got a pretty good – you got your toughest comparer in the fourth quarter. Is that what’s driving that or is it just still conservatism that you’ve build into the numbers?Perry WallackYeah, I would say that, if you’ve been watching us for the past several years that we tend to be conservative.Brendan J. Barnicle – Pacific Crest Securities LLCGreat thanks guys.Perry WallackThank you.OperatorWe’ll go next to Pat Walravens with JMP Group.Patrick Walravens – JMP SecuritiesGreat, than you very much. I guess, the first question is, as we look at all these growth drivers that you got in your business, how should investors think about what kind of growth rate that you can do beyond 2013?Perry WallackPart of it depends on our success expanding globally, so as I mentioned, as we get into 2014 and really 2015, how well we penetrate APAC and Lain America will become significant. Public sectors has been very lag for us. And so last year in Q3 we say very good pop in our business as you know we had very good bookings throughout the last year in Q3 at 79%. That was in part due to unexpected upside in federal business. I think we’re seeing the converse of that this year, were the federal government has essentially shutdown for business with sequestration and we’re not expecting that uplift this year in the third quarter. I think as we look in the outer years, as federal government goes back to business as usual.We will see that resume a significant potential upside for us combined with the success we’ve had with stable or growing education business. And we’re seeing continued ability to go to down market. So as we get more successful with our small business in the market teams, we will have further ability both the grow price per se and to keep growing the business overall.So we see lots of runway to keep growing the business. I’ve said this many time, receded a multidimensional framework, expanding internationally, expanding by segment meeting size of company and expanding by vertical, and we’re seeing the ability to continue to do that in all of three markets, in all three sectors. So we think, we can continue our industry reading growth for a while.Patrick Walravens – JMP SecuritiesOkay, and then my second question is we heard from a couple of sources that one of your competitors had a pre-significant how does last week, wondering if that’s something that you can comment on?Adam L. MillerNo, I actually….Patrick Walravens – JMP SecuritiesNo, I will come back on that. Thank you.Adam L. MillerI will say generally, we’ve seen post-acquisition many of these competitors that had have declining service levels as they become part of broader ERP suites. And that is the constant feedback we get from the market. And we believe that becomes a point of differentiation for us and that’s why you’ve seen us over the last several quarters make significant investment in our service offerings to be able to differentiate not just our product, but also on service delivery.Patrick Walravens – JMP SecuritiesGreat, thank you.OperatorWe’ll go next to Rick Sherlund with Nomura Securities.Rick G. Sherlund – Nomura Securities International, Inc.Thanks, guys. Question on the services contribution to the bookings number, actually to deferred revenues, is that a significant contributor to deferred revenues or is it mostly in the quarter or a revenue benefit?Perry WallackSo, we don't break things out like that Rick, what I will tell you is that we are making some efficiency changes in our services organizations and what can happen is, in any given quarter now and as much as the deal mix is more skewed down-market to mid-market we are doing the implementations a little bit faster and so deals that close earlier in the quarter we actually can get the services revenue in within that quarter, so what you may see and I'm not going to promise those deals depends on the deal mix going forward is that if we do sign amounts of smaller clients earlier in the quarter that we do have an opportunity to have more services revenue within that quarter.And obviously, if we have more services revenue, from those customers that will affect the amount that's going to differ…Rick G. Sherlund – Nomura Securities International, Inc.So, last year you had a $12 million increase, sequential increase and deferrals and that gave you the 79%, 80% billings growth in year-over-year. I'm a little concerned about the OpEx going in the September quarter due to some seasonality should be expect a similar, large sequential increase in deferred in Q3 this year?Adam L. MillerNo, so as I just said in response to past question and we saw the upside last year due to incremental sales for the federal government that we weren’t anticipating. This year we are seeing the opposite in federal sales meaning the downside case is real. And we have not performed well in federal I don't think it's specific to Cornerstone the market in general is having a difficult time, so like with federal government because of sequestration, as a result we do not expect to have that same incremental deferred booking that we had last year in Q3, but we are not making any promises about Q3 in terms of over achievement.Rick G. Sherlund – Nomura Securities International, Inc.And finally, if you could just talk to what you’ve seen in your pipeline following your June release and the conference, which was very positive?Adam L. MillerYeah, I think it’s very consistent to what I have been saying all year, which is we are seeing true growth in global demand for talent management. We are seeing that in every market, in every segment, in every vertical. And the result of that is growing pipelines across the board.Rick G. Sherlund – Nomura Securities International, Inc.Thank you.OperatorWe’ll go next to Justin Furby with William Blair & Co.Justin A. Furby – William Blair & Co. LLCHey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the quarter. Adam, you mentioned that the exit has already begun at (inaudible) and I was wondering if you could kind of elaborate there, you are already starting to see resilience and is it on the sales side, the R&D side? And then longer term, as you think about the tailwind that presents to you with Lars’ departure, what do you think is the biggest tailwind is, is it resources that might come over to Cornerstone, is it improved win rates, is it increased sharing within SuccessFactors, existing base, what’s sort of the biggest tailwind you think – you see out of the changes that are going on over there?Adam L. MillerSo all those things are true, but I would say honestly, the biggest tailwind is lack of focus. Meaning, we are entirely focused at specialist intelligent management and they no longer are. With regard to the management of that organization and the requirements and product about organization. So we end up being one of the only focused players left in the States. Intel management and that speaks our core constituency, which are talent management professionals and companies that are trying to improve the empowerment of their people all of which works to our advantage. We’ve seen resumes obviously in every one of these cases where the acquisition has occurred.Wonderful senior people lead the company, you see the rest of the organization start to update their hurricane profiles and soon they are after start to leave. We saw this very clearly with Taleo after the COO left. And I think you’ll see the same thing here.Justin A. Furby – William Blair & Co. LLCOkay. And then on the sales hiring side, how do you go Analyst Day, it sounds like you guys were stepping on the accelerator in kind of May, early May timeframe. Can you give us an update there and what do you think, those guys become productive instead of Q4 timeframe this year or how do you they ramp?Adam L. MillerYeah. So I mentioned that we were accelerating our sales hiring for the year, in the quarter. And we’ve done that, so our sales hiring has accelerated. We are not hiring more salespeople for the year, we are just hiring them sooner that we have planed to hire them. And that should result in some upside in the fourth quarter, probably will not have an impact on the third quarter.Justin A. Furby – William Blair & Co. LLCOkay. And then one last one you talked about febrile, but just in terms of the broader public sector that in the higher adding when we cater to all of them and say – how did that performance in Q2 and kind of, if you look at the next couple of years how meaningful the business could that be for your guys?Adam L. MillerSo here is where I would see significant case for optimism, because we obviously have been hitting our numbers and have been overachieving, despite the fact that the federal government has the sequestration problem and as the federal government resumes business as usual, I think we’ll see even further upside in the business overall. So our non-federal public sector teams have been outperforming, it’s just the federal piece that’s been problematic and that I think it’s a macro problem, it’s not specific to us. And I know that – people in other corporations as well. So we are continuing to invest in public sector very heavily.Justin A. Furby – William Blair & Co. LLCOkay, great thanks very much guys. Congrats.Adam L. MillerOkay thank you.OperatorWe’ll go next to Scott Berg with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.Scott Berg – Northland Capital MarketsSorry about that, Adam and Perry congratulations on another well executed quarter. Got a typical question to you, first of all, Adam on the cash that was raised in the quarter, obviously too early to predict how you’re going to use that, but one of the areas that we found fascinating by the Cornerstone story last two years is the organic message, how well that’s resonated with customers and we think we’ve certainly seen that from the deals come through during that period.But assuming you make an acquisition and I know that’s in the year, how would you view those acquisitions in terms of affecting that organic story? Not that they have to, but do they have the opportunity to change that or would you ultimately look at acquisitions not to infringe upon your core product today.Adam L. MillerYes, so the best example I can give you of course is on Sonar6, which was acquired in April 2011 not 2012 and in that case, we kept the product whole, we kept the team whole focused on a small business vertical which we were not active in at the time, and has given us a new vector of growth for the business, but it’s not at all impacted organic message in the enterprise, but thinking to be very attentive to that, if we made acquisition from the future and you would look for product to service offerings that are supplemental to what we do and do it infringe on the core of what we do, providing for deeper differentiation in particular segments of verticals.Scott Berg – Northland Capital MarketsGreat. And then one for Perry here, Perry, on the gross margin line, I know you send that to guide gross margins on a quarterly or even in an annual basis at times, but given that you’re into the Sonar6 acquisition, would we expect to see some leverage in that line, moving forward not looking for $4 million, $5 million, $6 million that’s obviously overnight, but even pretty stagnant in the 72 plus range, 72.5. Do we see any extradition or do they kind of outline at that for several more quarters?Perry WallackYeah. So we’re now looking out as this year yet. I think this year, we did expect a little bit of expansion in our gross margins, in the disclosure that I made earlier on the call was that we’re expecting to be about flat from last year, maybe a little bit of improvement over last year. The reason being is that we’re really using a lot more third-party implementation partners to solve the issue of really staffing to peak demand for implementations. So we want to continue to implement declines in a very timely manner and when we close deals, sort of on in any given month or at the end of a quarter, we really, really need to flex. And so in using those third-party implementation partners, the margins are a little bit lower. What I would expect is when we get around to our forecast for next year, we’ll look at the exact mix of what we’re using, and I would think that next year we would see some expansion, but no guarantees yet.Scott Berg – Northland Capital MarketsGreat. That’s all I have. I’ll turn back in queue. Thanks.OpeartorWe’ll go next to Raimo Lenschow with Barclays Capital.Raimo Lenschow – Barclays CapitalHey, thanks for taking my question. And congrats on another great quarter. And quick from me, you mentioned (inaudible) problems, can you talk on what it needs for you to the slightly bigger SIs and their willingness kind of work with you, and kind of build workforce around that, that was the first question. The second question is, can you just talk a little bit about moment on the SMB business, how you’re doing there, and what’s the competitive dynamic there? Thank you.Unidentified Company RepresentativeSure. With regard to the system integrators around the world, we are seeing a changing of the dance partners. Many of those companies have been working with our competitors prior to the consolidation in our space, they have now freed up and are looking to do deals with best supreme providers. So we are very actively engaged with all of the major system integrates around the world. And that I believe longer term will be incremental upside to our business. Don’t show up that much in 2013, but 2014 and 2015, I think it could be significant contributor.With regard to SMB, we are seeing essentially the exit of our core competition in that market. And so while there are some players left in that space, it is predominantly a Greenfield opportunity with relatively little competition, and it’s more about driving distribution.So our challenge is how we better drive distribution, how do we drive growth, and for us we have to make decisions about where it’s most efficient to put the next sales person is it on our U.S. enterprise team, is it in a Latin American enterprise rep or an APAC rep or do we add to our small business team or mid market team, and so it varies. We make different decisions based on lots of different inputs, and we will continue to grow that team both directly and indirectly over the next year or two.Raimo Lenschow – Barclays CapitalThank you.OperatorWe’ll go next to Greg Dunham with Goldman Sachs.Frank Robertson – Goldman SachsHi, guys you have Frank Robertson here for Greg Dunham. Congrats on the quarter, and thanks for taking my question. I obviously want to start with, I guess if you look at the number of deals you closed in the quarter, like what percent of them included – want a more – also different color on the entire installed base and what specifically recruiting attach rates?Unidentified Company RepresentativeYeah, so we are seeing really good pick up of recruiting, particularly from new sales. We’re seeing it both in enterprise and in mid-market and we’re seeing it both domestically and internationally, so it’s been clearly our fastest adopted product offering, and we see that momentum continuing, we just training of our sales teams globally on recruiting specifically to drive incremental growth there. So we think that’s a big upside opportunity. And with regard to our average deal, we’re seeing what we’ve seen before, which is more and more of our clients are buying two or more products upfront, and specifically two or more products upfront. And I think most recently the number we gave is about 60%, and we’re seeing that consistently across-the-board. I think over time that will go off.Frank Robertson – Goldman SachsOkay. And one last question, on the alliances and partnership, what percent of new business currently come from partnerships? How you think that it’s a turnover time longer term?Adam L. MillerYeah, its been about 15% to 20% and that’s been pretty consistent over the last couple of years. I think it will be, that number will trend down, I don’t expect it to trend up. And it’s because of the growth of our global sales teams, as we have wider and wider direct distribution, we would expect that to be less indirect sales and more direct sales.So I think that number will probably help around 10% or 15% over the long-term and as our mix shift to more direct.Frank Robertson – Goldman SachsGreat.Adam L. MillerLess concentration from any single partner, as we brought our partner basin as our ecosystem has grown though vertically and geographically. So we’ll see that continue to resolve.Frank Robertson – Goldman SachsThanks for taking my question.OperatorAnd we’ll take our final question from Brent Thill with UBS.Unidentified AnalystHi, this is Tom again for Brent Thill. Could you talk a little about the sales cycles or any trend there, whether you’re seeing acceleration and then if could maybe provide some color around large deal or so?Adam L. MillerWhat was the last part, large deal?Unidentified AnalystAround a large deal.Adam L. MillerSure, so the sales cycle is highly dependent on the market segment as some of the deals could be issued two weeks, midmarket is anywhere from two months to pipelines, enterprise trends to be forward in a nine months at the outside. And then we have a strategic accounts team that is solely for the largest accounts in the world and that could be six to twelve months.So we’re seeing the full spectrum deals is no difficult, no different than any typical enterprise sales team. What we’re seeing is a greater ability to onboard those reps upfront, drive them to greater productivity in the first year and ensure that all of our teams are hitting their target. So we’ve gotten better at regional distribution of targets and performance with each of our regional teams. So we have a very effective sales enablement program at the company. We use our own products internally to drive sales enablement and sales effectiveness and all of that has led to higher productivity of the reps and of the teams.So we’re quite pleased with the direction that’s going, and we think that will continue. With regard to the larger fields out there, we are seeing many of the largest companies in the world, could we consider their talent management strategy the overall HR solutions, and we are seeing a tremendous amount of activity in that segment. So we feel the team dedicated to focusing on that segment at the same time, we continue to globally expand our enterprise team, because we’re seeing large deals not just domestically, but around the world.Unidentified AnalystThank you.Adam L. MillerThank you.OperatorThat concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks.Adam L. MillerThank you all for your participation in your questions, and we look forward to continuing to perform. Thank you.OperatorThank you. That does conclude our conference. You may now disconnect.")

csod.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you. (Operator Instructions) We’ll go first to Michael Nemeroff "
            "with Credit Suisse.Michael Nemeroff - Credit SuisseHey, guys. Congratulations on a nice quarter.Adam MillerThank you.Perry WallackThank you.Michael Nemeroff - Credit SuisseJust kind of curious about how the replacement cycle is going. Are you replacing a lot of Oracle and SAP these days from some of the acquired vendors?Adam MillerNot so much. We’re doing a little bit of Oracle, specifically around the recruiting cloud. I would say we are also starting to see full suite deals where they are considering replacing everything and that could include a mix of the SAP and Oracle. As you know, because it could have both Taleo and SuccessFactors in the account, and they’re considering a single vendor for all talent management, but I would say for the most part, these are either net new deals or replacements of legacy systems.Michael Nemeroff - Credit SuisseThat’s great. And then if I may, one other one. You mentioned Adam, before that if you didn’t sign another new seat you could turn revenue 3x. I was just wondering, specifically what kind of programs or what are you targeting going forward that gives you the confidence that you can drive more upsell into the existing base? Thanks.Adam MillerSo we’ve very consistently have been able to upsell our client base since the beginning of the company. As you know, over 60% of our clients have two or more of our clouds, and we have a clear ability to cross-sell our products. What has changed is really two things, one, the suite has grown, so we have more products that we can sell into the client base relative to even a couple of years ago.And two, I think we have a better team going into next year that’s able to leverage the campaigns we have on the net new client side to start to more aggressively upsell our installed base. And if I were to add a third thing, I would say our service model leveraging our client success managers has opened up opportunities within the installed base that we might not have seen without having that level of service on the ground. I would say overall…Michael Nemeroff - Credit SuisseThanks very much for taking my question.Adam Miller…integrated talent management is becoming more and more important to companies generally, and we see that built broadly in new sales and on a micro level within our installed base.Michael Nemeroff - Credit SuisseThanks Adam.OperatorAnd we’ll hear next from Mark Murphy with Piper Jaffray.Mark Murphy - Piper JaffrayThank you. I will add my congratulations as well. Adam, exiting Q2 I believe you had said that there could be downside risk to the Federal business here in Q3. Just curious, how did that segment ultimately play out versus your expectations or maybe public sector in general?Adam MillerWell, I don’t know if you turned on the news during the last quarter. But as you know, the Federal government was not performing as well as they had in the past, to put it nicely. So, we I think met our expectations of what would happen in Federal which was very little. But overall, public sector has been performing fairly well. And specifically, what I would say is that the downturn that we’ve seen in the Federal government, which I think is not limited to Cornerstone.This is the macro problem I think in the U.S. It has been offset by the success we’ve had in state and local, K-12 and higher-ed, to offset the downturn we’ve seen. So that’s been helpful. Another way to put it is, had we even had a normalized year with Federal, we would have had even higher upside than we’ve had so far this year which has been very strong already.Mark Murphy - Piper JaffrayYeah. Yeah. Okay. So, Adam, as a follow-up, in our due diligence sessions we have heard some commentary that you’re benefiting from the rounding out of the clouds, so including learning performance, compensation, recruiting and so on and so fourth. And I think in a way it reminds us a bit of Salesforce.com’s evolution and they ultimately began to disclose the percentage of new bookings that were non-SFA or non-sales force automation. Just to try to demonstrate that it’s a multi-cloud story, I think that’s why they did that. Is there anyway you could begin to estimate your non-learning new bookings mix?Adam MillerYeah. I mean, as we’ve said before, learning is stated about 85% penetration across the installed base but everything else has increased. So not all of our clients have learning, many of our clients have more than one cloud. So if you just do the arithmetic, there is significant growth in the non-learning business across the board. I would also tell you that we are seeing a significant acceleration in penetration of the recruiting cloud. So we almost doubled our recruiting cloud penetration in about one quarter.Mark Murphy - Piper JaffrayOkay. Okay. The last topic I wanted to get into, Perry, I think you had mentioned ASP is up about 30% year-over-year. I’m just trying to understand, to what extent is that a mixed shift? We could look at it and say well, it’s more SMB with kind of naturally higher pricing, and maybe to what extent is it just the same profile of deals you were doing a year ago, but with less discounting off of list prices? And I guess if it’s the latter, what is causing that?Perry WallackYeah. So, we -- let me do this, let me answer it first and then, Adam loves to talk about this. First off, we don’t really break out the contribution in the waiting, if you will, between those two things. We are, as we’ve stated in the past, for the first nine months of this year, seeing the ASP go up for both of those reasons, right.It’s less discounting and it’s selling every customer more and more modules, okay. The mix of deals that we’re seeing is changing a little bit. We’re starting to go down market more, but our execution in enterprise, especially in this last quarter as Adam mentioned was phenomenal. And so with that, I’ll give Adam the opportunity to also embellish.Adam MillerYeah. So, as we’ve said before what we see generally is just higher effective pricing. We have not raised our list prices. We just discount less. I think part of that, is our brand has grown and our credibility has grown. Part of that is what’s competition in the space and part of it is a desire for an integrated suite.So, we get the benefit, both of higher effective pricing in those deals as well as the ability to sell multiple modules in the deal. And to your other point, obviously, as we go further down market, and more of our businesses from the mid-market and the SMB segments, we’re seeing just higher prices per seat in general. In some cases, it’s two to four times of pricing that we see in the enterprise.Mark Murphy - Piper JaffrayGreat. Thank you very much for taking my questions.Adam MillerThank you.Perry WallackThank you.OperatorWe’ll move next to Rick Sherlund with Nomura.Rick Sherlund - NomuraThanks, guys, good quarter. I’m wondering in response to one of the previous questions if the fed business that you mentioned, it was kind of not as good as that would have been otherwise if some of that got pushed out and you expected to close that in Q4. So, if maybe there are some catch up you would anticipate in? Also and you mentioned about new products and new growth initiatives, I’m wondering if you could elaborate a bit on what you are referring to there and what you are spending R&D on now.Adam MillerSo with regard to Federal, I would say that we are seeing significant pent-up demand that’s growing larger over time. I do not expect that to unleash in the fourth quarter. I don’t know if it will happen in 2014 or 2015. Congress still does not have any resolution around sequestration, so we simply don’t know.With regard to R&D spending, we have been investing very heavily in our new product initiatives. As you know, we rolled out the recruiting cloud. We’re working on an on-boarding module right now. We’ve been enhancing all of our products, learning, performance, succession, compensation, as well as the extended enterprise.And we are seeing the ability to go deeper with a better user experience than we’ve been able to -- than our competitors are simply able to because of all the integration work they’re doing right now. Our focus has been on social, on mobile and on video around all of our application areas and we’re seeing very good receptivity in the market for all of our product strategies.Rick Sherlund - NomuraThank you.OperatorAnd Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities has our next question.Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest SecuritiesThanks so much. Adam, I want to follow a little bit up on the government thing again, but more generally on, sort of, what you guys saw around the demand side in October generally. Did you see any change in demand trends as things may have loosened up around the Federal government or on Europe or anything more broadly?Adam MillerMy lawyer said I’m not allowed to answer that question. But I will tell you that generally we see no change in Federal. All you need to do is pick up a newspaper and you would know that there’s no real change going on there right now.With regard to Europe, as we said, earlier today we’re seeing great momentum in Europe. Our business there has not slowed down at all. Over the last couple of years despite the entire macro environment, all of the issues that have happened, in particular, in southern Europe, we’ve seen a very consistent ability to sell throughout the entire European market place.Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest SecuritiesGreat. And then last quarter, you in particular had highlighted new Connect in universal profile products. I was wondering if you had any additional color on what you saw of those new products this quarter?Adam MillerYes, so Connect, it’s still early. About 25% of our client base use Connect. Most of them are still on the older version. We have the second phase of that project that’s coming out in January. And we expect a lot of our clients to convert in Q1 and Q2 of next year.With regard to the universal profile, it had very good adoption and it has become the centerpiece of our application going forward. In effect, those projects Connect in the universal profile have been the centerpiece of the consumerization of the enterprise project that we’ve been doing for a while now, which has to do with making the interface much easier to use, much more modern in look and feel and extremely streamlined across all the different areas of functionality that we have in the system.The universal profile is a great example of a single place where a user has access to information about recruiting, learning, compensation, performance, succession metrics, and all other aspects of the system all in a single place. So it’s improved the adoption rate of all of our other products because it really is reinforcing this idea that holistic talent management is essential for corporation to be successful.Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest SecuritiesGreat. Then the last one for me, and we touched on it a little bit in the earlier question, as the number one question I get from investors is, you guys have been a nice beneficiary of the industry consolidation. And so how long can we expect that benefit to continue?Adam MillerYes, Brendan, I’ve answered this question at investor conferences before. I think, as soon as the consolidation occurred, which is now several quarters ago, there was the assumption that we would do very well for one or two quarters. This has now been going on for six or seven quarters. And we’ve seen no slowdown. In fact, I don’t believe this is a cyclical change. I believe these are permanent changes.We are seeing most of the intellectual horsepower behind Taleo now having left Oracle. And we believe the same thing will happen and has started to occur with SuccessFactors at SAP. So we think the impact of consolidation will only improve from here particularly with regard to SAP and then that will not recover. Meaning, these are permanent changes that are happening.Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest SecuritiesGreat. Thanks, Adam.Adam MillerThank you.OperatorAnd from Goldman Sachs, we have Greg Dunham.Greg Dunham - Goldman SachsHi. Yes, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just clarify the ASP increase of 30%. Is that related to new business bookings? Is that fair?Perry WallackYes.Adam MillerYeah.Greg Dunham - Goldman SachsOkay. And then, to dig in, I know you’re not going to quantify the impact in terms of just effective pricing and cross-sell, but you did highlight the client success managers and then they clearly are having an impact in terms of cross-sell. Is there any way to get more aggressive and to do things a little bit differently as you look out to next year? Do you want to formalize the process of cross-sell a little more? Any changes that we should expect?Adam MillerYes. There will definitely be changes going into next year. I think we’ll talk about them more specifically on our next call. But we have many plans underfoot for the organization of that team and how to accelerate our growth in the installed base.Greg Dunham - Goldman SachsOkay. Great. Last question for me and then Brendan asked that the consolidation question, the other question that we get often is you do hear noise from Workday, ADP and others that may or may not have been as competitive with you historically. Can you comment on how that PR actually is impacting the business and your thoughts on competing with them going forward? Thank you.Adam MillerYes. I mean, all of those companies are partners of ours. So there is a lot of commentary out there. The reality is we are jointly selling with Workday. We are aggressively selling with ADP and with others. There are obviously overlaps in some cases with the product suites with other products that these partners might have.But the reality is that we’re in a world of competition that it will only increase in the cloud space not decrease. And we believe that our entire focus on talent management in our level of specialization makes us the best-of-breed solution in this market. We think this is a very large market and we’re staying right here.So we think we have a very significant competitive advantage against any other player in talent management, particularly as the space continues to mature. We’ve had second and third time buyers who want an integrated solution, who understand the benefits of holistic talent management and want the best-of-breed solution for their people.Greg Dunham - Goldman SachsOkay. Thanks.OperatorAnd Patrick Walravens with JMP Securities has our next question.Patrick Walravens - JMP SecuritiesGreat. Thank you and congratulations to you guys. Is there -- are there any thoughts you can share with us that help us think about 2014 growth? I know you haven’t guided but is there anything you can share?Adam MillerWell, as you know we’ve had a significant investment over the last year in both APAC and in Latin America. We believe there is significant international opportunities for the business today. We’re still running about approximately 30% international in terms of both sales and revenue. We think that number can grow in the near-to-medium term based simply on expanded distribution around the world.So we’re putting people on the ground throughout Latin America, throughout Asia-Pacific. We are significantly expanding our teams throughout EMEA. And we believe there’s opportunity from that perspective. We also think, as I mentioned before, with the growth of the product suite and the adoption we’re now seeing around products like the recruiting cloud, that we have a lot of upsell opportunity within the installed base.And we continue to push the segmentation. So we’re going further down market and continuing to look at how to expand globally our SMB operations as well as going for the up market around strategic accounts. We’re doing that globally as well. So we see this as a truly global business opportunity. We now have about 13 million users in 190 countries using the system in 41 languages. We see a lot of opportunity to keep extending around the world.Patrick Walravens - JMP SecuritiesOkay. And then Adam, are you -- I think when we go to Dreamforce this year we’ll see that sales force has been putting a lot of effort into really improving its mobile solution. Are you happy with where your mobile solution is, and if not, what you need to do there?Adam MillerGreat question. I would say we got a late start to mobile. On the one hand that’s discouraging, on the other hand, a lot of people change their mobile strategy about 18 months ago and went from mobile web to native applications. We -- because we started late, started native. We have now a fully dedicated mobile team, building a complete mobile suite for iOS and for Android, so native applications.And we have already rolled out recruiting applications around each of our cloud. So learning on mobile, performance on mobile, recruiting on mobile and like recruiting, we get the advantage of starting a little bit late and understanding how the world has changed, understanding what is and is not important, our strategy is not to replicate the entire suite on a mobile device, but rather to capture the benefits of having something in your hands or in your pockets and be able to leverage extendable functionality around that.So whether we’re talking about taking training through a mobile device either online or offline or we’re talking about interacting with applicants, approving requisitions or moving applicants through the process around recruiting, or actually doing social connecting internally in an organization or managing parts of the performance process all through mobile devices, all of that is now underway. Much of that is released but we have a very aggressive roadmap around mobile over the next 12 months to supplement what we’ve already done.Patrick Walravens - JMP SecuritiesGreat. Thanks for taking my questions.Adam MillerThank you.OperatorWe’ll go next to Justin Furby with William Blair & Company.Justin Furby - William Blair & CompanyHey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Adam, I guess, first for you. I was -- there’s been a bit more discussion out there from some of the third-party industry analysts talking about how core HRIS is becoming a bigger influencer in terms of HR tech spend, your numbers continue to disprove that theory.So I guess, I was hoping you could sort of contrast that idea with what you’re seeing in the market. And I guess is there ever a time where you guys hit a certain revenue scale when you potentially change your mind and consider kind of entering in that core HRIS market?Adam MillerYes. What I would say is that the market demand for integrated talent management is very real. We’re seeing that around the world. Like we’ve said before, we think there’s 400 million potential seats for what we do and there’s 350 million that are greenfield. So we’re seeing a lot of opportunity out there, specifically within talent management.Our view around HRIS is really twofold. One, all of our top partners have core HRs as part of what they do and we don’t want to go head-to-head with them around that. We think it’s much more beneficial to us to be working with them right now.And number two, we believe a lot of the large enterprise installed base is already comfortable with an existing core HR system. So we have focused instead on integrating with those systems.We have done literally thousands of integrations with Oracle, SAP, old versions of Oracle, specifically PeopleSoft, ADP, Workday, Lawson, Ceridian, you name it and that has allowed us to view the entire world as an open opportunity, instead of limiting ourselves to a particular subset of that market. And we believe this further plays into our specialist versus generalist argument. And it’s a big reason for our success that we’ve been very specialized on talent management.Justin Furby - William Blair & CompanyOkay. So you’re not seeing yourself in deals where that tends to be a big differentiator. I mean, how often are you in a deal where you get sort of [DQ] it because of not having that as an option?Adam MillerAlmost never, because if that was the case we would bring in one of our partners.Justin Furby - William Blair & CompanyOkay. Okay. And then on analytics market, that seem to be sort of a trending topic at HR Tech. I’m just curious if you could sort of grade yourself in that market versus your competitors and then maybe talk a bit about your plans there going forward?Adam MillerYes, so we think about analytics as really three different markets, maybe four. The first is standard reporting, the kinds of reports you would get out of a system that any end-user could leverage. We are very strong there. We’ve have been doing that from day one. Custom reporting, which is allowing a client to build any number of custom reports. This is something we’ve been doing for a long time. We have continued to invest in this area. Our products have gotten stronger and stronger in this area and I think we’ll continue to evolve.The third is predictive analytics. This is really leveraging the big data that we have and is something that we’re working on going forward. And the fourth is really leveraging that big data to do more things around functionality but something we also do, it’s part and parcel with how we do recruiting, how we do succession, how we do the extended enterprise. And we believe there’s more products and services we could offer over time leveraging the data that we have.Justin Furby - William Blair & CompanyOkay. And then one more, if I could, in terms of the -- you mentioned video is one of your focus points. There has been some discussion around these online courses at the -- in the higher end market. Do you think, longer term, does that potentially become a competitor to you and how are you positioning yourself in that space?Adam MillerNo. I mean, we view books, we view universities that the consumer plays out there all as content providers. We are working with all of the top e-learning providers in the world, and continue to expand our library as there are new forms of content out there. We just believe that most of the proprietary content built by corporations for their own internal use will shift from web-based or flash-based content to more video-based content. And so we’ve been evolving our system to be able to better handle that type of engagement with the employees.Justin Furby - William Blair & CompanyOkay, great. Thanks very much.OperatorAnd it looks like we have time for one more question. That will be from Michael Long with Needham & Company.Michael Long - Needham & CompanyThanks very much. Just a couple of questions for you guys. In terms of the lower end of the market, I’m wondering if you can talk about Sonar6 now that’s performing relative to the expectations. And could you share an update on how your partnership is going with Salesforce probably via the Cornerstone for Salesforce was unveiled earlier. I wanted to get an update on that?Adam MillerYes. The Cornerstone for Salesforce is going well. You’re going to see that. To enforce, we have a significant number of joint clients now with Salesforce including Salesforce itself and continue to expand our market opportunity there. We believe that is a very strong solution for managing sales effectiveness programs, or sales training programs and we think there’s a significant opportunity also within our own installed base for that solution.With regards to Sonar6 which today is Cornerstone Small Business or CSB, we’ve seen good growth in that group. We think there is a lot of incremental opportunity there as well. We think we can grow it globally. We’ve now put a team in place in EMEA, we’re growing with team in APAC. We are significantly expanding a team in U.S. We have folded it into our sales management organization and believe we can significantly extend our opportunity there, both through a growing direct sales team and through indirect channel partners.Michael Long - Needham & CompanyGreat. And then, last question please. I wonder if you can comment on the NetSuite acquisition of TribeHR, do that surprise you? Do that suggest more competition at the lower end of the market and where do you play, I just wanted to get your perspective on that. Thanks.Perry WallackNo. It didn’t surprise us. We don’t view it as particularly competitive. And they are operating in a really different segment than we are. We view it as a logical evolution of the financials market where we’re seeing a lot of competition now amongst the providers of financial tools and a lot of them are expanding into HR as well, particularly in core HR, tying core HR and financials together. So we don’t view that as competitive and that has not impacted us at all.Michael Long - Needham & CompanyGreat. Thanks so much.Perry WallackIt’s also worth mentioning that the volume opportunity in SMB is so large. There are literally millions and millions of accounts globally that any acquisition by anybody in the SMB space would be of little consequence to the market opportunities for CSP. It’s just such an enormous greenfield opportunity right now.Michael Long - Needham & CompanyMakes sense. Thanks guys.Perry WallackThank you.Adam MillerThank you.OperatorAnd gentlemen, at this time I’ll turn things back to you for closing remarks.Adam MillerThank you all for your participation. And we look forward to speak to you on our next call. Thank you, everyone.OperatorAgain that will conclude today’s conference. We thank you all for joining us.")
# 2013 q4
csod.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Michael Nemeroff "
            "from Credit Suisse.Michael Nemeroff – Credit SuisseHey guys thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on a good quarter and year.Adam MillerThank you.Michael Nemeroff – Credit SuisseAdam I just want to understand the competitive environment and whether you guys are progressing on new product implementations for customers that have never used and ACM product before or are you seeing and how you are seeing the uptick in replacement of some of the competitive solutions that have been acquired by larger vendors?Adam MillerWell as you know for years we have particularly in the enterprise segment we have been doing replacements of the on-premise competitors and that has continued. In fact the momentum has increased on that. Within the mid-market and certainly the SMB segment it’s more greenfield and so this is typically the first system made for them but the enterprise it’s almost always replacement.Michael Nemeroff – Credit SuisseAnd then the second question is on the services sounded like you had to use more third party implementation team this quarter. I was just wondering if you are planning on increasing the number of implementation teams or if that is just for overflow and you are kind of happy with the current size of the implementation team program.Adam MillerYeah so we think of the company’s as a three leg stool, with sales and marketing in one leg, service and support the other and technology in the third and we have tried to keep the company in balance over time because we over perform throughout the year and that again from a sales perspective in the fourth quarter we simply had to outsource more because we staffed to the mean, which is the expected average throughout the year.We have some spikes in sales throughout the year at the end of each quarter and at the end of the year and as a result because we over achieved we had to outsourced more than we expected during the period.Michael Nemeroff – Credit SuisseThat’s great. Thanks very much for taking my question.Adam MillerThank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Greg Dunham from Goldman Sachs.Frank Robinson – Goldman SachsYes, Frank Robinson here for Greg. Thanks for taking my question. I want to hit on ASPs, I am not sure whether I missed you quantify whether it was up year-over-year but if you could quantify that it would be great and also kind of what drove the lift and whether your ASP guidance expects some kind of uptick over 2014 as well?Adam MillerSo, we saw average selling price go up between 25% and 30% through the year across the broad within mid-market in particular it was up about 30%, and that was driven both from the lack of discounting as we had fewer competitors in this space, there is less price pressure and we are able to hold the list price rather than discounting as much. The second is increased products per sale, so we are selling more products with each of the initial sell and that also resulted in higher ASPs.Frank Robinson – Goldman SachsOkay. And are you expecting some kind of – some kind of uptick next year as well?Adam MillerWell, I am not going to forecast that’s going to up another 30% but we have seen on a year-over-year basis a very consistent increase in the average revenue per user and we do expect that to continue as we add more product and expand our suite.Frank Robinson – Goldman SachsThanks for taking my questions.Adam MillerThank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Mark Murphy from Piper Jaffray.Mark Murphy – Piper JaffrayYes, thank you very much. I’ll add my congratulation. Adam I wanted to ask you the global strategic relationship with Deloitte. Obviously, that is a huge HR consulting practice and I am wondering if you can provide any more details on some of the contractual parts of this. For example, any thoughts on how significant the revenue potential from this relative to some of your other partnerships with ADP, [Huerte] or SVS and others? And then also, do you have any feel for how many employees Deloitte will dedicate to go into its Cornerstone practice?Adam MillerYes. Good question. So Mark, as you know we have strong line with regard to what kind of resale we expect to get going forward from our partners, so as we continue to build out direct sales force, we think the indirect resale channel will shrink proportionately. However, we are doing many more referral and teaming arrangements and Deloitte is a good example of that where we will leverage our ecosystem partners like Deloitte to help us penetrate and expand on enterprise deals that we are working on around the world.So this is a global deal. We are working with Deloitte in Europe in Asia and in States and they are helping us for penetrating accounts and to better service the account overall. The partnerships like these are critical to our ability to growing and they are building a practice around Cornerstone, they are building it within capital consulting practice. As you might know Deloitte is the only big consulting firm to have human capital as one of its dedicated pillars and so they are the largest HR consultancy in the world. As a result, have very good relationships with the kind of that we sell to around the world.Mark Murphy – Piper JaffraySo Adam, just given how closely Deloitte has already been working with Workday, is it fair to think of this as their way of recommending companies to use Workday for co-HR and to use Cornerstone in conjunction with that for the talent management or – am I reading too much into that and it’s clearly their recognition of the kind of market dominance that the Cornerstone don’t has built here irrespective of anything else going on?Adam MillerThe way I think about it is similar to the Taleo deal where they are effectively picking the winners, and clearly we have become the winner in our space and as a result we are seeing the opportunity to partner with the best companies out there.Mark Murphy – Piper JaffrayYes. Okay. And then Perry, I wanted to ask you as well. You have moved down market in the last couple of years but you maintained this 95% retention rate and I guess I am wondering do you think that the did you get there by the enterprise retention rate actually increasing above 95% or have you somehow corrected the code on kind of producing a down market retention rate that’s also coming in at 95%?Perry WallackSo we don’t break out the mix exactly, Mark. What I can tell you is, we have had churn in the lower end of the market and mid-market and that’s been historically the same percentage or proportion of our retention in the past as it is today. So basically mix has not changed. We will continue to see excellent retention in the larger enterprise and as we become more mature with our services offerings, we will probably see the retention in the mid-market go up a little bit, but basically no real change.Mark Murphy – Piper JaffrayOkay. And then Adam I want to ask you one last one on the topic of SuccessFactors. Have you seen any indications of any kind of organizational destabilization over there in recent months? For example, I guess now that the calendar has turned over, are you seeing any greater volume of SuccessFactors resumes out there or are there any other potential signs of fall out subsequent to a large departure?Adam MillerMark, as you know, since May I have been predicting the demise of that organization coming in March and I stand by that and I have many more data points to back that up now. But I suspect you will see a mass exodus happening from the former SuccessFactors entity come late February throughout March.Mark Murphy – Piper JaffrayThank you very much.Operator(Operator Instructions). The next question comes from Pat Walravens from JMP Securities.Patrick Walravens – JMP SecuritiesGreat. Thank you and congratulation to you guys. Adam at the beginning of your remarks you talked about some changes in the way you are segmenting the sales force in terms of where you have cut-off. Can you just talk about what drove that and what are some of the key benefits from making those changes?Adam MillerSo we are seeing a lot of opportunities down market particularly with the Taleo moving Oracle and SuccessFactors moving SAP. There was less focus from our competitors on the lower mid-market and our mid-market reps because they had a pretty broad range of companies they were selling were as expected selling to the higher-end of that range. That’s one of the reasons ASPs were going up and it’s one of the reasons that we performed extremely well without significant increases in unit volume.But we see that there is still a significant opportunity down market. So we decided to segment the mid-market team into upper and lower mid-market. We are calling the upper mid-market team our mid-market team and we are calling the lower mid-market team major accounts, and we see a lot of opportunity in both segments. We also continued to build out our SMB team which is selling all the way down the markets for us.Patrick Walravens – JMP SecuritiesGreat. Thank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Justin Furby from William Blair & Company.Justin Furby – William Blair & CompanyHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Alan I want to go back to kind of your market sizing. I think you mentioned if I didn’t mistake you $20 per seat per product. And I guess if that’s true the way you are sizing it, how do you get there from sort of the current pricing today which I think sort of implies low teen and that’s more on the blended basis?Adam MillerYes. So again as we go further down market, we have the opportunity to increase pricing per seat. We have seen that very clearly over the last two years, the further down market we go, the higher the price point is, it’s often 2x to 4x, what we are receiving from the large enterprise segment, and we think as we continue to smooth out our sales between the upper and lower ends of the market spectrum we are going to price points continue to revolve.Take those numbers and you apply that you get size of our existing client base excluding the expanded enterprise and you end up with fairly large numbers. The expanded enterprise of course provide large opportunity because in those cases you are not limited to number of employees of the client but rather their expanded enterprise customers, partners, resellers, contractors and alike, which often is a multiple of the size of the organization internally and we end up with a higher pricing.In addition to that, overtime we will continue to add products, with more products we add more per seat.Justin Furby – William Blair & CompanyOkay, great. And then in 2013 you guys were really consistent each quarter on the billing side anywhere from mid-40 to mid-50, I guess as we look forward in 2014, I realize you can’t guide for that but give me all the opportunities both in your based and outside of it, is there anything that tells you can’t maintain that type of rate in 2014?Adam MillerAs you might be aware I don’t like to answer questions like that. What I can tell you is our momentum is strong, our sales teams are growing at the same pace that they have been growing over the last couple of years and the pipelines continue to grow in line with the sales teams.Justin Furby – William Blair & CompanyOkay. That’s fair. And then Perry quickly on the services organization, can you remind us how big that is today and if I heard you right it sounded like for Q4 what prevented you from outperforming guidance on the revenue side was a mix of just of implementation and consulting services versus plan and that it sounds like some larger deals that are delayed. Is that right and then if it is what’s kind of the sizing of the services today as relates to the overall business?Perry WallackYeah. As you know we don’t breakout the relative percentage of services versus software. What I can tell you is that as Adam has told you we staff internally so we can meet the mean requirement for implementations and we use partners to flex to the peak. Often times those partners take time to and as much as we have lots of large enterprise clients that those partners are working on, it can take a little bit longer to ramp.In addition when you have executed very, very well on the large enterprise market, we have to understand that those implementations, number one they just take more time, they happen over several quarters. And in addition very, very large clients often change the timeframe on us which is as I said on the call out of our control. And so as their business needs change they often will delay the timing of the implementation. And so what all of that adds up to is very, very difficult method to predict exactly when the services revenues is going to come in.Justin Furby – William Blair & CompanyOkay great. Thanks guys.OperatorThe next question comes from Brendan Barnicle from Pacific Crest.Brendan Barnicle – Pacific Crest SecuritiesThanks so much guys. Adam following up on the services question. We have seen a lot of companies in last year at least that start to re-ingest their business implementation strategies because they couldn’t find their capacity to do their implementations and that has unforeseen effect on companies. Do you guys foresee any sort of strategic change that way for you this year and I guess it follows up certainly probably to Perry’s comment about the kind of unpredictability around some of the services piece or is there going to be a bigger range in your guidance now to account for something like that?Adam MillerNo not at all in fact we have the same strategy for many years. We outsourced about a third of our service projects, because we are staffing for the mean and not for the peaks. We have peaks at the end of the quarter which means from an implementation standpoint, you have peaks at the beginning of following quarter each quarter and we now have partners and employees that can scale with us. Aperio and TribeHR are both good examples of that who are scaling with us not just domestically but around the world and we are working in lock step with them to ensure that we have the right capacity overtime and so we are not changing our practice of law.We do think we’ll be able to smooth out some of our service revenue and some of our service project management through projects like our 123Live initiative which takes our mid-market service projects and does them much more rapidly through the focused program when the clients comes on site and we’ll do those deployment typically in three to four weeks instead of in two to three months which is obviously extremely rapid for an enterprise implementation and extremely effective for many different reasons from our standpoint.Brendan Barnicle – Pacific Crest SecuritiesAnd so….Adam MillerWould you like that to better our service operation?Brendan Barnicle – Pacific Crest SecuritiesAnd also there is no change in the way you are thinking about guidance to how you are incorporating the guidance?Adam MillerNot at all.Brendan Barnicle – Pacific Crest SecuritiesGreat. And I just want that to be clear I think it’s pretty clear from the call, but have you moved down market and continue to make more of a move down market it sounds like ASPs won’t be impacted by that change?Adam MillerNo if anything ASP will go up.Brendan Barnicle – Pacific Crest SecuritiesPerfect. Great. Thanks guys.Adam MillerThank you.OperatorOur final question comes from Brent Thill from UBS.Unidentified AnalystHi, this is John on behalf of Brent Thill. I just had two questions. One on if you can give an update on recruiting traction with clients? And then second it tends to be at least from SAP and Oracles from their point it seems to be increase in intensity and just wonder whether you have seen anything out of that? Thank you.Adam MillerI am sorry Brent, increasing what?Unidentified AnalystA lot more intensity around their efforts to pursue clients.Adam MillerYes I think the reason there is more intensity is because we are beating them over and over again in their deals in their backyards and so they become extremely aware of course now even at the parent company level. What we’re seeing is the ability to keep selling around the world we’re growing our sales team not just down market but also I should mention up market. We’re seeing a real ability not just to sell to the mid-market in SMB firms but also to sell to largest enterprises out there, we have built out strategic downstreams that allow us to go further up market than we have traditionally and we are seeing a very strong win rate even at the highest of the markets.We have mentioned some of those names on this call and on other calls like BP and Roche and many others, we are seeing that our approach as a specialist against the world of generalists in talent management has been very well accepted by the market and is allowing us to continue to win in all segments, in all geographies.Unidentified AnalystAnd any update on I think the customer traction with the recruiting product?Adam MillerYeah. So recruiting has been growing very well, we recently launched our high volume recruiting capabilities so that we’re able to sell to our retail clients as well as our other industry clients. And we’re seeing good uptick in all segments in recruiting. So we’ve been able to sell it to large enterprises, small enterprises, the mid-market and the lower mid-market and we are selling in all geographies. So we’ve been selling domestically, we’ve sold in Europe, in Asia and we think there is opportunities to keep building that out. The predominance of sales have been for new clients and we have seen it both in and full suite and in standalone recruiting deals. I suspect in 2014, you are going to see us do a lot more business with our existing clients in recruiting as their contracts come up with some of their existing vendors like Taleo and Kenexa.Unidentified AnalystThank you.OperatorThere are no further questions, I would now like to turn the call back over to Adam Miller, CEO for closing remarks.Adam MillerThank you all for your participation and we look forward to another strong year. Thank you.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference for today. Again thank you for your participation. You may all disconnect. Have a good day.")
# 2014 q1
csod.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) So our first question comes from Brendan "
            "Barnicle from Pacific Crest. Brendan, please go ahead.Brendan Barnicle - Pacific CrestThanks so much. Adam in your comments you were discussing, as you move down market, the increase in ASPs, as you make that transition, will that give you better visibility and predictability, as you move away towards that and move away from larger deals? And if so, when might we see that start to show up in the numbers?Adam MillerThe answer is absolutely, particularly for that segment because it happens more on a monthly cadence than a quarterly cadence. In fact, in some cases it happens weekly. So you’re not waiting till the end of the quarter to see how you did, it’s happening on a monthly basis. Having said that at the same time we’re going down market, we’re also pushing further up market and so to a certain extent those two things net themselves out. And I don’t know to what extent it will change the predictability in the business, it might slightly improve it and the ASP should continue to rise, but it will not dramatically change the overall predictability because those two (extremely) [ph] cancel themselves there.Brendan Barnicle - Pacific CrestAnd Adam, did you see any change in the U.S. enterprise market during the quarter?Adam MillerNo. None at all.Brendan Barnicle - Pacific CrestAny areas in the world where you saw changes, or any verticals in the market, where there was a change from what you'd seen previously?Adam MillerNo I would say the main difference was as you know from the last call, we made significant changes with sales organization moving our mid-market team up market and bringing in a new team down market, the major accounts team. As a result of that change we moved a lot of our mid-market reps further up market and we promoted many of them to a management position on a major accounts team, but that left during the quarter a little bit of a vacancy in that segment which obviously is getting filled now. And I think we’ll see the real benefits of that as I mentioned earlier in the second half of the year.Brendan Barnicle - Pacific CrestBut did those vacancies have any impact on bookings or closings?Adam MillerNo, but it had, I would say the impact was more on units because at the low end of the market we did not sell as many units as we normally do, because of the fact that we have this transition. But I think you’ll see the inverse of that happen in the second half of the year. As that like really ramps up.OperatorThank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill from UBS. Brent, please go ahead.Brent Thill - UBSHi good afternoon. Perry, just on the short-term deferred $6 million versus flat last year, is there any reason why you saw that change in terms of the seasonality? And I had a quick follow-up for Adam.Perry WallackYes, sure. So Brent when we look at deferred revenue, we actually don’t look at it between short term and long term in isolation. We look at it in total and I think what you’ll find is that first off and I mentioned this in the previous remarks that deferred revenue goes down every single year between Q4 and Q1 and that’s due to the seasonality of our business.Second off, if you look at them in total, you'd find that we were down just above 5% versus around 2% in the prior year period. And so one of the other things that you have to look at is the mix of revenue that’s being recognized in the quarter versus the mix of revenue that’s being added from new clients in a quarter. And if that mix skews off between software and services meaning if you’re recognizing a little more services revenues in any given quarter versus adding even more software in that quarter from new client sales, you can see that reduction change a little bit between years.Brent Thill - UBSOkay, great. And, Adam, just as a quick follow up to Brendan's question, there was obviously a lot of controversy on some of the sales changes and the impact that you felt in the quarter. And it sounds like that there wasn't a major impact, but certainly when you see these changes, there's room for some deals to move around. But I guess, from your perspective, are most of the changes done now, so that any re-optimization you've done, you should start to really feel that kick in as a tailwind for you going forward?Adam MillerYes, I think in particularly in the second half of the year, you’re going to see the benefits of all the changes we’ve made and we were very clear as we were making them the changes that the company is moving to the next phase of growth, we’re in this for the long term. And as a result we knew that we had to make some short term changes to position the company for long term continued growth, that’s exactly what we did. And we believe we’ll see all the benefit of that starting in the second half of this year.OperatorThank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nemeroff from Credit Suisse. Michael please go ahead.Michael Nemeroff - Credit SuisseHey guys thanks for taking my question. Nice quarter. I'm sure you're glad you can talk about it now.Adam MillerExactly.Perry WallackThank you.Michael Nemeroff - Credit SuisseAdam, could you give us a sense for what the pipeline of recruiting deals looks like? Some of the research that we’ve been uncovering is that there’s a lot of dissatisfaction on some of the larger customers that Kenexa and Taleo had signed a couple of years ago, now that a lot of those are coming up for renewal. So can you give us a sense for what that looks like over the next couple of quarters?Adam MillerYes, I would say that the pipeline for recruiting is definitely very strong. And the pipelines overall are extremely strong. So we have seen continued demand around the world that’s why we have that reorganization in sales force just to reiterate a lot of people associate reorganizations with the layoffs that absolutely did not happen here. We’ve never had a layoff in the history of the company. In this case, we reorganized which meant predominately promoting a lot of people in order to allow us to dramatically expand the sales team globally which is what we did at the end of the last year and the beginning of this year. We won’t see the benefit of that but at the same time we continued our marketing and demand generation efforts and never slowed those down so the pipelines are very robust.Michael Nemeroff - Credit SuisseSo, maybe you could just put the issue to bed, and just give us a sense on how the bookings were in the month of April, at the start of the second quarter?Adam MillerWith my lawyer sitting here I definitely cannot answer that question.Michael Nemeroff - Credit SuisseOkay. Perry, just on the billing terms, was there any change in the billing terms that would have affected the billings number at all this quarter? Or was it similar to the previous year’s quarter?Perry WallackNo, it was all similar.OperatorThank you. And our next question comes from Justin Furby from William Blair. Please go ahead.Justin Furby - William BlairI got kicked off, so if I’m repetitive, apologies. The recruiting product, Adam, where are we with penetration today in terms of your install base and where does that go in the year; where do you think that could go?Adam MillerSo it’s over 10% now and we think it will continue to grow last year, it went from roughly from 2% to 10%. And we think overtime it will get to 60% just like performance. Now, I can’t tell you with what rate it’s going to get to the 60% but we see no reason from the demand that we’re seeing across the board from our client and from the prospect, that it won’t be identical to two performance overtime.Justin Furby - William BlairOkay. And do you feel like its more middle-market today, in terms of what the opportunities you’re seeing, or across the board?Adam MillerNo, it’s definitely across the board and around the world.Justin Furby - William BlairOkay. And then on the partners, this quarter, what percentage were partner led deals or implemented deals versus you guys? And on the Aon and Deloitte deals, just to be clear, are these just consulting engagements? Are they actually going to be taking on SI work as well?Adam MillerSo I'll answer the second question first, in both the case of Deloitte and in the case of Aon Hewitt, these are the largest consulting companies in the world or amongst the largest. We also have a relationship as you know the Accenture. And the opportunity for us to service our accounts globally as well as get introductions to new accounts around the world through these partnerships is very real and that includes in some cases, general consulting work in other cases, very detailed system integration work and in still other cases, processes like outsourced administration and integration work happening by all those partners.Justin Furby - William BlairOkay, and then the percentage?Adam MillerAnd then to answer your first question, we read the notes that come out. I know there was a lot of confusion this quarter based on a couple of very isolated conversions with partners. As all of you know we have many partners today. We give different partners different types of work. We do not give all of our work to all of the same partners. As a result, partners tend to have very skewed perception of what the reality is at Cornerstone. And that’s all due to a combination of the work we do in-house, as you all know we’ve grown our team significantly over time as well as the type of work we give to those partners. So for example certain partners only get midmarket work. Other partners only get European enterprise work. So it varies by region it, varies by segment, it also varies by vertical and therefore it’s impossible for a partner to really to understand the overall picture of the company.Justin Furby - William BlairOkay. And so, I'm sorry -- I missed it if you said it -- but what -- did you give us the number in terms of this quarter, what it looked like for you guys versus the aggregate partner community?Adam MillerAre you saying partners that have come in and partners that we've outsourced services to?Justin Furby - William BlairJust in terms of the new customers you sign, I'm just curious if it's helpful to know, how many of those are you guys actually going to be putting in the software versus some other person, some other partner?Adam MillerYes that’s the amount of work we do, that varies by quarter because the business is seasonal. We tend to staff to the mean. We do the same amount of services during the year by our team so that our people are fully utilized. And we will outsource different types of projects to different partners at different times during the years. So there is not consistency there on a quarterly basis on an annual basis, it equates to about 30% of services.Justin Furby - William BlairOkay, great. And then just last one, I know you can't really talk to April versus March. But is there any -- I guess, how does bookings feel versus your expectations for Q1? And then is there any reason why they don't accelerate into Q2?Adam MillerSo what I would say about bookings in Q1 is they meet our expectations, they were in line with what we thought we would do and as you know Q1 generally for the company is not a significant quarter as it relates to the overall bookings on an annual basis and the proportion that’s done in Q1, also tell you if some of you have discussed before in your notes that we did have some very large deals that we're working on which will now happen later in the year, not in the first quarter. And as a result, had any of those deals come in earlier we would have had substantially higher bookings for the quarter. Even one of those deals would have had a material impact on the quarter. And we believe even without that deal we were exactly in line with where we expect it to be, and are well positioned for Q2 and the entire year.OperatorThank you. And our next question comes from Mark Murphy from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead, Mark.Mark Murphy - Piper JaffrayThank you very much. Adam, following up on that, just given your earlier commentary that you are hunting for even larger organizations, how would you assess the deal pipeline entering Q2 and beyond? Just in particular on the larger side, are you seeing larger opportunities versus a year ago in terms of seed count, in terms of multi-module deals, or in terms of bookings opportunity?Adam MillerYes, absolutely. We see more large enterprise activity in the pipeline than we ever have before. And that is true not just in North America but around the world.Mark Murphy - Piper JaffrayOkay. It's great to hear. And then, Perry just drilling into the billings a bit more, your Q1 billings have typically contributed about 15% to 16% of the full year total, as Adam said, not that much really. I'm wondering, as we consider the reported Q1 billings, did you expect when the year is over and everything is said and done that that will be within that range of about 15% to 16%? And would it be fair to use that as a guide for building a full-year model?Perry WallackYes, so good question Mark, but unfortunately you know we do not guide to bookings and so I can’t answer that question without really guiding the bookings. What I would say just in general, so everybody has the appropriate perspective on bookings, and this is really no different than many of the other staff companies is that, bookings can really vary from quarter-to-quarter, there are a lot of different things that can move around whether that’s the billing terms that large enterprises can demand, whether that’s the number of large enterprises that can close in a quarter, the number of deals obviously, there is just a lot of things that move bookings around. And so in generally it's a proxy, it’s one of the proxies for judging the growth or the health and welfare of the organization, but it’s just one of them. And so we need to keep that in perspective, you know oftentimes when people talk about is better to look at it on a rolling four quarter basis and that can be instructive but the bottom line is we don’t guide to bookings and they can be very, very variable.Mark Murphy - Piper JaffrayAnd so, Perry, as a follow-up relating to that, I think we heard you state that billings duration or term, I think didn't have a material impact. You had also mentioned the timing of services. Just curious, if you net that out, did that -- in particular benefit or hinder any of the metrics that we're seeing in Q1?Perry WallackYes, no there was no material impact from any of that.Mark Murphy - Piper JaffrayOkay. One last one, Adam. How material do you think Aon Hewitt can become as a partner, just if you compare it to what you expect in the future from Deloitte or Appirio or Accenture or ACS or any of the others, is there any way to compare it in terms of how many employees they will train or certify or just what kind of uplift you think they can deliver?Adam MillerYes, what I would say in particular is that, with the addition of Aon Hewitt we now have a very well rounded partner ecosystem with all of the major consulting players working with us and allowing us to service account truly anywhere in the world. In addition to that, Aon Hewitt in particular is working closely with half of the Fortune 100. And I think a third of the Global 100. So today their client base represents exactly the kind of large global enterprises we’re going after at this point particularly with our strategic accounts group and positions us well in that segment of the market.OperatorThank you. And our next question comes from Greg Dunham from Goldman Sachs. Greg, please go ahead.Greg Dunham - Goldman SachsHi. Yes, thanks for taking my question. You know it's good that you're reminding us that these big deals can be lumpy and can also flip. I guess, have you seen any differences in terms of what's causing the slippage this year, versus in years past? Any differences in terms of the scope of the deals that you're doing that could help maybe provide some color?Adam MillerYes, I mean the one thing I would say in particular about Q1 is that we’re working on some deals that have extremely large scope and scale and as a result the procurement process is longer than for example a major accounts deal which might be completed in a matter of hours, so you have a significant difference in the procurement process given the size and complexity of these deals, also the number of partners involved in deals like this, we’re talking about the global FIs, they obviously get involved when you're talking about the largest companies in the world, and as a result, it’s very difficult to ‘time’ those deals. Do they happen in some ways when they’re going to happen, and we look at the overall pipeline on a rolling basis, we look at the overall health of the organization on a rolling basis and we feel like we were absolutely in line for Q1 and that had even one of these deals come in early, we would have blown away any of the expectations about the first quarter, instead we’re in line with expectations for the first quarter and we’re well positioned for the future.Greg Dunham - Goldman SachsOne follow-up, if you permit me. You listed a ton of companies, Philips, Nissan, through the list of brands that we all know and I know one of the things you highlighted going into the year is deeper penetration into those accounts that you already have. Where are we in that progression? And what are the signposts we should look for this year and next, to gauge your progress there? Thanks.Adam MillerYes, good question, I would say in some of those accounts it has to do with the pace of the global rollout, so we’re talking about in many cases accounts of over a 100,000 users, in some cases over 200,000 or 300,000 users, and as a result, the rollouts don’t happen overnight, they take a while, they involve often regional deployment and in many cases sun setting existing systems that they had in place that we’re replacing. As a result one measure is how quickly and how effectively we’re rolling out globally and I will tell and you'll hear this story at Convergence in San Diego in a couple of weeks, many of these client beat their internal expectations of how long it would take to roll out and we are routinely the fastest global deployment they’ve had of any system they ever tried to deploy at that scale in any application area. That’s one way to measure it. A second way to measure it is the product penetration within those accounts and we are seeing more and more of those large enterprise deals, include a suite of products, often buying two or three products upfront and then very quickly following that up with additional product purchases, so that penetration becomes another measure of the stickiness and effectiveness of our products in those accounts.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays, sir please go ahead.Raimo Lenschow - Barclays CapitalThanks for taking my question. A lot of them have been answered. But, one thing, since we saw a decent amount of IPO activity in your space, with mid-market vendors coming to the market, can you talk a little bit about the competition you are seeing in the mid-market there? A lot of them, we didn't know beforehand. Is that something that you look out for? And then a lot of question, there are a lot of investors asking us on Workday, and the potentially changing nature of the competition there. Thank you.Adam MillerYes, what I would say with regards to the midmarket specifically is that we've had the same basic competitive set that we’ve had for several years and we don’t see any difference in that arena, in fact if anything there have been acquisitions of lesser known players in the mid-market space particularly in certain geographies and verticals which has made it easier to sell into that segment. With regard to our larger technology partners, we’re as I’ve mentioned before on prior calls, we’re obviously in a world of cooptation and so we have several partners including Workday where there is some overlap in our products but we partner much more than we compete.Raimo Lenschow - Barclays CapitalYes, can I -- if I do like, can do one follow-up. If you think about the account management team that you started now that seems like a big opportunity. Can you talk a little bit about where you are in terms of product penetration of the different products in the accounts, and how quickly do you think that can deliver?Adam MillerYes so, as we’ve mentioned before Learning is about 85% penetrated, Performance about 60% penetrated, Succession is about 30% penetrated, Comp is about 20% penetrated, Connect today is about 25% penetrated and Recruiting is still only at about 10% it’s over 10% today and of course On Boarding is not yet out, when it comes out, it will obviously have no penetration since we’re just starting. We see upside opportunity in all those accounts, two thirds of our accounts today have two or more products and that’s across 1,700 plus mid-market enterprise accounts, so we clearly have the ability to upsell and cross sell our products. We clearly understand the relationship between the products as you think about managing the employee lifecycle and we believe we have become the only true specialist in a world of generalists and that gives us very significant advantages not just in new sales but also with regard to upselling the install base which we’ve been doing very aggressively now.OperatorOkay, thank you and our last question for today will come from Rick Sherlund from Nomura, Rick please go ahead.Rick Sherlund - Nomura Asset ManagementA couple, if you -- you sound like you're pretty confident about the timing of the big deals in the second half, but you haven't really said anything about Q2. Is there -- and it's probably prudent that you cannot pin yourself down on Q2. But is there a likelihood that we could see some of these larger deals hitting in Q2?Adam MillerIt’s absolutely possible.Rick Sherlund - Nomura Asset ManagementOkay. And as far as go-lives, I know that affects, when you can recognize revenue, the implementation. Was there any variability in terms of the pace of partner implementations that impacted Q1 in any way?Adam MillerNot in particular, we continue to onboard our partners particularly these newer global FIs that are starting to do some of the service work as well, so we’ve been spending time, working on enabling those partners but overall there hasn’t been a material shift in the timelines to get those done. We continue to expand the use of 1-2-3-live which is (all wrapped) [ph] in implementation process in the mid-market and that dramatically reduces the implementation time 1-2-3-live literally refers to three weeks before the client is live, and in the case of some of the larger mid-market deals, that is a very significant accomplishment that other companies simply aren’t able to do in this space. So, we’re seeing the opportunity to keep speeding up our implementation times, we think we will be able to continue to do that particularly as our overall business shifts to a more equivalent mix of enterprise and mid-market or down market deals and we continue to refine and improve our processes overall.Rick Sherlund - Nomura Asset ManagementAnd at the user conference upcoming, we're going to hear about Onboarding, a few new things, or what else are we going to hear about, architecture, new UI, what else should we be anticipating?Adam MillerYes, so we’ve been very vocal about our consumerization of the enterprise initiative where we have been over the last 2.5 years now dramatically improving the overall UX to the application to make it consumer like, so it works and it's as easy to use as a consumer internet application. In addition we’ve added a lot of functionality to our existing products for example in Recruiting, will be the first enterprise class ATS to have true campus recruiting fully integrated and are organically built into the product, we are continuing to build out our mobile capabilities and our analytics capabilities we’re going to be talking about all of those things.OperatorThank you. I’d now like to turn the call back to Adam Miller for closing remarks.Adam MillerThank you all for your participation and we look forward to speaking to you again soon. Thank you.OperatorOkay, ladies and gentlemen this does conclude your conference. You may now disconnect and have a great day.")
# 2014 q2
csod.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperator(Operator instructions.) The first question comes from Brent Thill from"
            " UBS.Brent Thill – UBSThanks, good afternoon. Perry, on the guidance I think everyone’s curious given the magnitude of the bookings in Q2 that you would imply that that services build would start to take hold, and it sounded like you had a much stronger quarter on the new customer signings. So I guess there’s perhaps a disconnect on the guidance relative to what you’ve booked and I’m just curious if you could just explain that. I think it’s all in the services but is there anything else that is causing you any caution as it relates to the guide on anything else in the core business?Perry WallackNo, there’s absolutely nothing. Look, what we’ve communicated on I think nearly every call or every call since we’ve been public is that our revenue can vary based on the timing of when our services are implemented. And as we’ve talked about on previous calls we’re closing a lot of really, really big deals. We work with the federal government, we work with state and local governments and sometimes it is just not that easy to predict the timing of those services. We’re working more and more with third-party implementation partners and so controlling them and controlling their timing is just more difficult and it’s just, you know, causing some variability. And I would say there’s absolutely no change in anything that we’re doing in the business.Brent Thill – UBSOkay. And just a quick follow-up for Adam on the large deal, it sounds like that was the biggest deal you’ve ever had. Can you just give us a perspective, I know they’re not going to just start falling because that one closed, but your perspective on what this does now on your pipeline – what you’re seeing in the strategic accounts business now with this one underneath your belt?Adam MillerYeah, I mean in many ways this validates our entire strategic accounts strategy. It was the largest initial deal we’ve ever done, it’s almost an eight-figure deal, and that is the whole point of creating a separate Strategic Accounts Team. So I think it bodes very well for that initiative and for the opportunities ahead with that team in particular.Brent Thill – UBSThanks.OperatorThe next question comes from Brendan Barnicle from Pacific Crest.Brendan Barnicle – Pacific CrestThanks. Perry, I wanted to follow up on your comment about the 12% cash flow margins. As we think further out how should we think about those cash flow margins changing and building as we look out to next year and beyond?Perry WallackYeah, sure. So at this point we’re not going to be giving any guidance for 2015 but what I would point to is our historical trends with that metric and also with our non-GAAP net loss. And historically what we’ve done is we’ve improved upon the prior year metrics incrementally. So I think in 2013 we had close to $21 million in non-GAAP cash flow from operations; this year the guide is at $33 million. And what we would at this point say is that we would expect all of those trends to continue.Brendan Barnicle – Pacific CrestGreat. And then Adam, Asia-Pacific was one of the strong reasons that you called out. I know when we were at the Analysts Day you mentioned that you were sort of deemphasizing some of the spend there or rolling it out a little more slowly. Has this changed given the success you had in Q2 or did you end up not going through with that change in terms of strategy?Adam MillerYeah, I’d say we’ve always been very disciplined about how we spend money and we typically will follow spending after success. And now that we’re seeing some momentum there we’re going to reengage in our investment strategy there. So we’re growing our teams in India, Australia/New Zealand, China and Japan, and we’re seeing real activity in all regions.Brendan Barnicle – Pacific CrestGreat, and then just lastly on that big, eight-figure deal – how long does a deal like that take to close?Adam MillerYou know, that’s an interesting question. As you know we do many, many seven-figure deals and they vary tremendously in the duration it takes for a deal to happen. This one I would say was on the shorter side of that spectrum in the scheme of things. I mean obviously this is a full-on enterprise deal so you’re talking nine to twelve months but when a deal gets this large the client tends to have their act together and has made a lot of decisions, and has firm deadlines and a clear process; and we followed into that process and that timeline. And we’re seeing something similar happen in other deals like it.Brendan Barnicle – Pacific CrestGreat, thanks a lot.Adam MillerThank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Rick Sherlund from Nomura.Rick Sherlund – Nomura ResearchThanks. Adam, I wonder if you can just remind us on the revenue rec side, so this particularly large deal on the quarter, we’ve been told they’re out looking for implementation partners right now. The revenue recognition begins when, and second if you could just kind of talk a little bit about the pipeline going forward in terms of number of additional deals that might be of that magnitude – and what is this saying about the number of non-big deals in the pipeline, how is that holding up?Adam MillerYeah, let me answer the second question first and then I’m going to hand it over to Perry to talk about the revenue recognition. With regard to the activity that we’re seeing at large, while we have done some very large deals and we did a number of large deals this past quarter, and we’ve seen that consistently growing out over the last several quarters, we also had the largest number of units we’ve had in a long time and I believe the third largest net increase in units in the history of the company over the last quarter. So I don’t want to say that. You’re setting up an exclusive choice and that’s not what we’re seeing. We’re seeing the ability to both grow our overall business in terms of the number of accounts that we’re bringing on and the ability to go further upmarket and do even larger deals than we’ve done in the past. Perry?Perry WallackYeah, sure. So Rick, our rev rec, not speaking specifically on a deal-by-deal case, is that we recognize the services of our deals as we perform them, and we recognize the software smoothly over the course or life of the deal. I don’t want to comment exactly on the rev rec for a specific deal but 90% plus, 95% plus of our deals are recognized in that manner.Rick Sherlund – Nomura ResearchBut the rev rec begins when you sign the contract for the software piece?Perry WallackThat’s correct – software is recognized smoothly over the life of the deal and services is recognized as we perform those services.Rick Sherlund – Nomura ResearchOkay. And the composition of the pipeline going forward, other deals of this magnitude we might look forward to in Q3 or Q4?Adam MillerYeah, I mean as I say every quarter our attorneys say I can’t answer that question. Like I said, we are seeing real opportunity in the strategic accounts segment and we continue to be very bullish about that segment overall.Rick Sherlund – Nomura ResearchThank you.Perry WallackThank you.Operator(Operator instructions.) The next question comes from Greg Dunham of Goldman Sachs.Greg Dunham – Goldman SachsHi, yes, thanks for taking my question. You made a number of changes to the sales organization earlier this year as you scale the business, and that caused obviously a headwind in Q1 in terms of bookings. Clearly with some of the strategic account deals that you’ve talked about and the number of deals on the lower end side you’re seeing an improvement, but the question is, is that still a headwind for you or is that already a tailwind to the business? Or is that more on the come?Adam MillerSo Greg, honestly it depends on the specific sales team that we’re talking about. We have seen the changes already take effect in some segments or on some of our sales teams. In others I believe we’re not going to see the full impact until the second half of the year. So I’m not going to say we haven’t already seen some of the benefit, we have particularly when we think about midmarket and major accounts, but there is still opportunity in the second half of the year particularly around things like client sales that have not taken full effect because they have longer sales cycles. So you make the change in Q1, you’re not going to see it in Q2 – you’ll see it later in the year. So we’re very pleased with the changes we made and the impact we think it’s going to have overall.Greg Dunham – Goldman SachsMakes sense. And one last one: federal was a great sector for you two years ago; last year it was a little bit more challenging. What are the expectations going into the federal spending kind of season this year?Adam MillerYeah, so I’ve been pretty consistent about this. I think the jury is still out until we get thorough another year. Two years ago it was great; last year it was horrendous, and this year I think the jury is still out on what happens. This is the big selling season going into Q3 and I’ll tell you next quarter. [laughter]Greg Dunham – Goldman SachsAlright, thanks guys.OperatorThe next question comes from Michael Nemeroff from Credit Suisse.Michael Nemeroff – Credit SuisseHey guys, I’m sorry I joined late to the call, I was on a couple other calls this evening. But looking at the billings for the quarter were strong and I understand that maybe some services were a little bit delayed, can you just give us… I know you don’t guide to billings but are you expecting a meaningful acceleration in the second half in terms of new business signings?Perry WallackSo Mike, look, we don’t guide to billings or bookings, you know that. Adam’s given a few comments on the momentum of the business that we’ve seen for the first half of this year and we try to leave everything right where that is without commenting on pipelines or expectations for the second half.Adam MillerYeah, I will tell you that several teams are still scaling and we see the pipeline as being very strong and growing globally. We’re seeing our distribution continue to increase internationally and we’re continuing to expand the size of our teams in all segments. So there’s opportunity on all fronts. We’re going to see some of that in the second half of this year; we’ll see some of that going into next year. And we’re very bullish on the overall opportunity. As you know, the competitive landscape is completely changed. We are in a very strong position in the industry and we’re seeing a lot of greenfield opportunity ahead. We still have as an industry the ability to grow at least six times and we’re seeing that ourselves in our own business.Michael Nemeroff – Credit SuisseThat’s helpful, Adam. And then just on the services side of the business I don’t know if you broke this out but what percent of the revenue is services currently and do you expect that to change meaningfully over time? That is, as potentially some of these deals get larger are you looking to offload more of those services to third parties and help you there?Adam MillerYeah, so we as you know don’t break out service revenue but I can tell you that as we continue to grow services as a percentage of our overall business will continue to go down. One thing that impacted the variability of Q2 that’s worth mentioning is seasonality. We had a difference, a change in seasonality in Q2 than we’ve seen in other quarters, particularly since going public where a large percentage of the deals – not only the big deals, really across the board – happened at the very end of the quarter. And going back to Rick’s question about revenue rec if deals happen at the end of the quarter versus earlier in the quarter you get very little recognition of the revenue in that quarter. And that’s what we saw in Q2 and that was different from what we had seen prior to Q2.Michael Nemeroff – Credit SuisseOkay, thanks for taking my questions.OperatorThe next question comes from Justin Furby from William Blair and Company.Justin Furby – William BlairHey guys, thanks. Perry, could you clarify the duration comments you made in your prepared remarks? I think you said you had a headwind on the durations and [revs] to bookings. Can you just give us a sense on the magnitude there? On a normalized basis would it have been 45%, 50%? What’s a better way to think of it in terms of duration?Perry WallackYeah, sure, so it would have been maybe a point or two points. It’s not as I said, they were materially in line with our historical averages but it was a bit lower so it’s maybe a point or two.Justin Furby – William BlairA point or two of a headwind that you faced because you billed for less upfront?Perry WallackThat’s right.Justin Furby – William BlairOkay. And then just to be clear, the big deal, the eight-figure deal that you called out, I’m assuming that hit your Q2, at least the first year of that hit your Q2 billing?Perry WallackLook, I don’t want to comment on the specific billings of any one specific deal. As we talked about, the total billings for the quarter were materially in line with prior quarters. For new sales, the amount of billings that we had upfront were a bit lower than our historical averages and if we normalize that to our historicals in total it would have been a point or two higher.Justin Furby – William BlairOkay. Okay, great. And then I didn’t quite follow, Adam, your comments on the seasonality. Why do you think it happened where it was backend loaded and I think the one concern is well, what did pricing look like if you’re doing a bunch of deals in the last few days of the quarter? So any comments there would be helpful.Adam MillerYeah, so just on that last point, we are not changing our pricing to get the deal in at the end of the quarter. We are not running the business that way; it’s not a healthy way to run a company. And I have heard from other CEOs that they experienced the same thing in Q2. I can’t explain it, I really cannot. In particular this Q2 had a Monday close, meaning the last day of the quarter was a Monday, so you would think conceptually all deals that were going to happen that quarter would be done by the Friday. That wasn’t true for us and for many other companies that I’m aware of. I will tell you also that that was an anomaly, so I have not seen that before and it doesn’t seem like that’s continuing. We’re not expecting it to continue.Justin Furby – William BlairOkay. Okay, fair enough. And then Perry, are you changing the way you’re guiding revenue for Q3 and for the back half of the year just based on what you saw on the consulting side or I guess how are you looking at your guidance? And it does feel like if you look at the back half of the year just given kind of the magnitude for Q2 that it’s obviously effectively a raise for the second half of the year in revenue. So just kind of walk us through that I guess.Perry WallackYeah, sure. I mean look, what we want to do is obviously we want to beat and raise, so what you’ve seen is for Q3 we’ve widened the range a little bit so we’ve got a $2 million range for Q3. And we’ve held our guidance for the full year because we have closed a lot of very, very large deals. And while we can estimate to some level of accuracy the timing of those implementations you can’t perfectly forecast it. And so I guess what I would say is we’re getting back to our old ways and it always pays to beat and raise.Justin Furby – William BlairOkay, great. And then one last one if I can, in terms of, Adam, it sounds like the upsell business within the existing base, I think you made a comment that those are longer sales cycles. I guess I would assume they would be shorter – you already have the relationships there. So maybe why would those be longer sales cycles?Adam MillerThat’s a great question. So historically they’ve been relatively short and they continue to be relatively short based on historical norms. What I’ve been talking about as the upside in the second half of the year is this shift from a farming model to a hunting model, and in the hunting model it does take more time to close the larger opportunities. So we are already seeing that that team is back to its historical norms. Our expectation with the reorganization of the Client Sales Team is that they will exceed historical norms, and that will take some time.Justin Furby – William BlairOkay great, thanks guys. I appreciate it.Perry WallackThank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.Raimo Lenschow – Barclays CapitalHey, great, thanks for taking my question. A quick question first, Perry, for you, just following on here on the revenue outlook for the second half. So if you do the math in Q3 you talk about 41.0% growth and to get to the full-year midpoint, Q4 is 49.5% growth. So are we kind of thinking, well I guess you want to be conservative but it seems to be some big acceleration in Q4 coming – any kind of idea of how that’s going to happen? And then a question for Adam is can you talk a little bit about, if you think about the eight-figure deal, what’s kind of the attach of the different products there? So has that kind of driven a large deal because of the number of users or is that because you are achieving bigger attach rates of all the different product components? Thank you.Adam MillerYeah, so in terms of the strategic account deals it’s a combination of a couple of different things. So one is the size of the deals are just obviously naturally larger – these are bigger companies. Secondly, the complexity or the value that the client is getting out of the deal is larger because they tend to have a more complex heterogeneous environment that we’re walking into, and when we reconcile that environment we’re giving them very significant cost savings. And thirdly there is upside with some of these larger deals to make them multi-module deals, and as we’ve mentioned earlier we’ve seen a move in the large enterprise from about two products on average to much closer to three products on average in the initial deal. So we are seeing greater ability to sell more product to the larger clients upfront.Raimo Lenschow – Barclays CapitalOkay. Perry, anything?Perry WallackYeah, sure. So what I would say is that if you look historically there is a trend in our revenue where we do recognize a little bit more revenue in Q4. There’s lots of clients that like to get things live before the 1st of the year or get them live earlier in the quarter so that they can start running processes by the end of the year. So we do sometimes see a spike in those service revenues in Q4, and look, our guide is I guess reflective of that seasonality in our business and reflective of this timing issue that we have on our services that we perform for our large enterprise customers in the federal government.Raimo Lenschow – Barclays CapitalPerfect, thank you.Perry WallackSure.OperatorOur final question comes from Scott Berg from Northland Capital.Scott Berg – Northland Capital MarketsHey Adam and Perry, congratulations on a good quarter.Perry WallackThank you.Scott Berg – Northland Capital MarketsTwo quick ones from me. First of all, Adam, on the bifurcation of the Midmarket Sales Team you seem to be pleased with the progress to date. But can you give us a sense of how far along you are in the progress of that transition? Are they at full capacity running as you would expect them to on a long-term basis today or are we still a quarter or two out from that?Adam MillerYeah, so I would say they are not yet at full capacity. They are ramping up to that and the ramp has been maybe even a little faster than we expected. I think part of that is due to some of the promotions we made, putting experienced managers in place and letting them build out their teams. Secondly we are not done building those teams, so those teams will continue to get significantly larger over time. So when you talk about the medium-term opportunity they’re not even close to what they could be.Scott Berg – Northland Capital MarketsOkay, great. Then my last question is on the international business which is strong, and you talked about a growing business in APAC. Are you seeing any differences in what customers are buying in those geographies? And I ask because their adoption rates tend to lag North America by several years and the products they tend to buy are a little bit different. I’m just curious to know if you’re seeing any true differences there or is it in line with the rest of your markets?Adam MillerThat is the common perception, that the other markets lag the US markets. What I’ve found is that at least for Cornerstone, the European market is actually ahead of the North American market. They are earlier adopters of full-suite purchases. They are more avid users of integrated talent management; they better understand the process and I would say in general are a little bit more mature. Now that can be explained by the fact that a lot of these organizations are multinationals built by acquisition, so even at relatively small scale they have somewhat complex infrastructure requirements and complexity in terms of how they manage their people.Our tools are very good at managing that complexity, and so we are starting to see the US think the same way that the Europeans have been thinking for a couple of years and that’s creating a lot of opportunity for us. APAC is definitely still behind that curve. They’re still thinking about it one product at a time, but we are seeing faster adoption of cloud computing there – I think in part brought upon by the work done by some of our cloud brethren out there. And we’re seeing greater ability to do larger deals in some of these geographies, because as you know some of the companies are able to grow to a much larger scale than they might be able to in the US. So you have many more employees in the average company in APAC than you would often in North America, both of which create a lot of opportunity for us.Scott Berg – Northland Capital MarketsGreat, that’s all I have. Thanks for taking my questions.Adam MillerThank you.OperatorI would now like to turn the call back over to Adam Miller, CEO, for closing remarks.Adam MillerThank you all for your questions and your participation, and thank you again to the Cornerstone team for another great quarter. Thanks, everyone.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference for today. Again, thank you for your participation. You may disconnect. Have a good day.")
# 2014 q3
csod.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions). The first question comes from Greg Dunham from"
            " Goldman Sachs.Greg Dunham - Goldman SachsMy question. I guess first off, I appreciate you guys quantifying the different impacts to the business from a bookings, FX and a services implementation dynamic. But when you look at the 7 million reduction in the annual guidance, can you help quantify how much of that is services? Is that the majority of the change or is it more balanced?Perry WallackYes. Sure, Greg. This is Perry. Yeah, as I said in the prepared remarks, it is primarily due to services. The foreign exchange piece of it is probably going to fall out at somewhere between $0.5 million and $1 million for the fourth quarter. And the underperformance of our emerging business units and, obviously the underperformance from a bookings perspective in Q3 and what we expect in Q4, contributes another couple million dollars, and the remainder is due to the services delays.Greg Dunham - Goldman SachsAnd then quickly just so I have the math right, accounts and currency growth in billings was 35%? Is that correct when you adjust? When you do the 34.2?Perry WallackYes, that's correct. $84.2 million at 35% year-over-year.Greg Dunham - Goldman SachsAnd you reiterated that you see -- you guys as a 30% to 35% revenue grower for the next couple of years. But how should we think about margins going forward? Typically, when a SaaS company slows down growth, you start to see more leverage. How should we think about that when you look out to ’15 and ‘16?Perry WallackSo, it's a little bit early for us to guide on those kinds of numbers. What we would say is directionally we’ve always been improving margins. This year you're going to see our gross margins remain flat and partially due to the acquisition of Evolv you'll see the operating margins just improve a little bit or stay flat.But, directionally, on cash flow, we always make improvements and it is our intention to be driving toward profitability. As we get through our sales planning and figure out where we want to start to invest for 2015, we'll look to solidify those improvements.OperatorThe next question comes from Brent Thill from UBS.Brent Thill - UBSAdam, I just want to understand clients delaying their implementations. Are they slowing things down because they're focusing on other priorities? Are they -- just can you help us understand what dynamics at play there?Adam MillerThe real issue here is that as we delve deeper into larger client sales, including a couple that we have done this past year which are multi-million dollar deals that have big implementation components to them, the project teams on the other side often are dictating the timing of the implementation. And in one case, the largest deal we did this year, this project chain was slow to start. They had a change in personnel during the process and the result is a shift in the go-live timing by at least a quarter, if not two quarters. And that has a major impact on our ability to recognize the revenue associated with that service delivery. And that's typical unfortunately for the largest clients out there. And as we do more big deals we are going to see delays as a result we've become more conservative going forward in the way we're forecasting revenue associated with those kinds of deals.It's worth mentioning that our standard deals still operate at exactly the same levels they've always operated at and in fact in some cases we've speeded it up, we've sped it up. So we have opportunities, I think to continue to speed up the implementation times for our smaller clients and get more consistent in how we're forecasting the opportunities for the larger clients, and that's why you see us getting more conservative in our future guidance.Brent Thill - UBSSo that comes back, and that feeds into my second question. Obviously, this year has been really uneven relative to what you guys had expected and given to the street. But to come out and say 30% to 35% growth for the next several years, considering what has happened, I think there's a disconnect that investors will have with that versus the last three quarters. Is that just because the book business you see right now is just going to come back in terms of you see a visibility of that book business and some of these delayed contracts start to kick back in and that gives you confidence in that statement?Adam MillerYes. I want to be really specific about this because I think this is the most important point of the call. We are not expecting a sudden uptick in business that is not what we're forecasting here. What we have seen and what we try to bring to light during this call is our core business has been extremely consistent over many years, including this year. Those teams have hit their numbers all year long and that is the reason we still have 40% plus revenue growth, 35% plus bookings growth. And we think that core group will continue to perform at minimum over the next three years. Why three? Because that's the furthest out we can see right now, it could continue way beyond that.What we see as being totally inconsistent is the emerging businesses, the new markets that we're in where we don't have a consistent track record. We have times of brilliance, but not consistency throughout the year. And so, what we have done on a go-forward basis is dramatically reduced the expectations for those business units, but kept the same well proven expectations around our core businesses. And that's why you see us setting the guidance at 30% to 35% over the next couple of years. It's very consistent with our historical business.OperatorThe next question comes from Michael Nemeroff from Credit Suisse.Michael Nemeroff - Credit SuisseJust two really. One is, given the lowered expectations, are you planning to make any changes to the sales structure or the organization or management in the areas of the business that haven't performed well over the last couple of quarters?Adam MillerYes, and we already have.Michael Nemeroff - Credit SuisseAnd those changes took effect in Q3? Did you anticipate that those were going to become some sort of a disruption over the next couple of quarters?Adam MillerNo. Those changes took effect in Q3 and Q4. And it is business as usual. The core teams by contrast have had no changes, only growth. And that growth continues.Michael Nemeroff - Credit SuisseAnd building on the previous question, could you maybe give us a sense of the booked but not billed backlog to demonstrate the strength in the core business bookings that you're really expecting investors’ to believe that you have signed, but are struggling on the timing of the implementations?Adam MillerYes. I can answer that pretty quickly. You could see it in our cash flow, I mean a lot of these deals that are paying upfront, they're just not receiving -- they're not completing the service work in a timely basis and as a result the revenue recognition for those services gets dragged out, but it doesn't go away. They've already paid for it it's already underway. These are large implementation teams on both sides often with third parties involved. So it's simply a matter of timing, it's not a matter of whether or not it's going to happen.Michael Nemeroff - Credit SuisseBut if I look at that the cash flow statement, the cash flow has actually been pretty negative. I know that you focused on the Q4 number, but the cash flow looks pretty negative over the last two quarters?Perry WallackYes. Just to add to what Adam said the point is that you know we don't focus on cash flow for the first three quarters of the year and that we bring it all in, in Q4. And so when you look at our cash flow performance and our estimate for the full year that's where you see that we're really continuing to bill the clients at a pretty healthy clip.OperatorThe next question comes from Michael Huang from Needham.Michael Huang - NeedhamJust to follow up on a couple of those previous questions. So I think in your prepared remarks you had talked about perhaps in the changes that you were making to help either accelerate implementation times -- I know that you've taken some expectation out, but was wondering if you could walk through maybe some of the actions that you could take to help drive some shorter implementation cycles. Obviously, some of that's in the control of your clients, but was wondering if there's anything that you guys can do to help shorten that up a little bit?Adam MillerSo certainly down market, we are growing our mid-market operations. We have many more clients today down-market and that will smooth out our service delivery over time, as it becomes a larger percentage of total service revenues. With regard to speeding up implementations down-market, we introduced something called 1, 2, 3 LIVE, which allows for three-week implementation cycles, which is much shorter than our average 109 days.We also are working on processes to put into place up-market for the largest clients to rectify what we call client project readiness, which is the client's availability to complete a project or to get it done on a timely basis. So, it should be noted that it is not delays on our side. We have the resources. We have the processes. We have the teams in place to get these projects done. We also have third-party implementation partners operating in some of these cases. So we have the resource availability.What we're driving to is more efficiency both on the client side and on the partner front. And in both cases, we have enablement teams and new processes going into place to speed up the client readiness to do these initiatives. The other aspect of that is the amount of work that the client needs to do. And so as we take on more and more of that work from the clients, not only does it potentially drive more revenue but it speeds up the project overall.Michael Huang - NeedhamAnd when you look at the emerging areas and maybe drilling into that a little bit, were there any of these areas that stood out to you as being more challenging than the others? I mean, obviously you are talking abroad array of different areas. In those areas that maybe stood out to you, like what would you attribute the challenges to?Adam MillerI mean, the primary issue in the third quarter and the primary impact on the fourth quarter, without a doubt is public sector. And that has been the most challenged group. In fact, you could allocate virtually the entire miss to public sector. And we've been making changes in that organization already. And I think we have the right solutions for the market. It's a matter of getting the right people in place to make sure that we have an effective process to bring in those deals. And we've been doing a lot of work on that front and we'll continue to do even more going forward.Michael Huang - NeedhamDo you attribute it more to sales execution issues as opposed to something that is out of your control?Adam MillerWell, I think it's a combination of -- the federal space being predominantly -- just government spending in this particular area. We have not seen a lot of it, it's not that we're losing deals, there is just no deals happening in our space. By contrast, on some of the other teams it could be in some cases sales execution. So it's a mix if I look at public sector at large and we're taking action on all those things.We've also, on a go forward basis, again dramatically reduced our expectations around these areas into the future, which does, obviously, particularly two, three years out, provide significant potential upside. But right now, we're not comfortable forecasting significantly those business units.OperatorThe next question comes from Justin Furby from William Blair.Justin Furby - William BlairI just wanted to follow up on the 30% to 35% growth. I guess, I appreciate the comments around the next three years and you feel like you have visibility there, but I just wanted to get a little more comfort there. I mean, the numbers are getting bigger. It seems like, if anything the competitive landscape isn’t getting any easier. And I just wanted to kind of drill into that again.And then, Adam, separately, you talked about sort of your 5% assumption in terms of what you're baking in for the other end markets. What does that look like if you look at it sort of through this year and then last year? What did it previously look like in terms of contribution to growth at those other areas?Adam MillerI mean, to answer the second part of the question first, remember some of these are brand new. So the contribution of those teams was relatively insignificant. Take Latin America or Asia-Pacific, those teams essentially didn't exist and therefore weren't being compared against anything. Just our expectations about what those teams could do haven't worked out and they haven't materialized. So we don't see those groups going away we just see a longer time horizon for them to hit what we think could be meaningful numbers for the business.If you look at public sector, we obviously saw a big drop-off in federal business over the last couple of years relative to three years ago. If you look at some of the other groups, just not as much growth as we anticipated. By contrast our core business has been operating very successfully, and I'm talking about enterprise and mid-market sales both in the U.S. and Europe, and including both new client sales and existing client sales. And those teams have operated quarter in and quarter out for many years now, including all of this year, and we see the forecast, we see the pipelines for those teams. We understand the competitive dynamics very well for those teams. And we understand where we've invested from sales force expansion in each of those different groups. We understand what our productivity metrics are moving towards and we see our ASPs rising and our per-user revenue rising for those groups. All of those are positive signs. All of those indicate no slowdown in that business at all. And we translate to specifically 25% growth over the next couple of years -- 25% plus growth over the next three years just for those groups.And keep in mind, the Evolv acquisition ties in perfectly to our core business, in particular the enterprise business, both in the U.S. and in Europe. We are seeing really significant demand from our client base for predictive and prescriptive analytics. And that acquisition and the products we will generate through the combination only further increases our confidence in the ability of the core teams to keep growing.Justin Furby - William BlairSo maybe just what will be helpful is if you kind of look at last year, and 50% or so bookings growth versus high 30%s year-to-date, what's the delta there? How much is it from these other areas? How much is the core business just slowing because it's getting bigger? How can you reconcile growth last year versus year-to-date growth?Adam MillerWe don't really slice it out like that, but most of it is because of the lack of incremental business that we had anticipated happening from these emerging groups. So whether it's growth in public sector or APAC or SMB or strategic accounts, we just haven't had the level of growth that we were anticipating. If we had it, our growth rate would easily be in the mid-40s at this point, and there'd be no question about what's happening this year.Justin Furby - William BlairAnd then, just quickly, Perry, on the guidance, I felt like the commentary on implementation, in terms of being more conservative, sounded very similar to last quarter. So can you quantify what's different from last quarter in terms of how you're hair-cutting it or what you are doing? And then, just operationally, what exactly are you doing there to give yourself -- and maybe you covered it, but I missed it, what operationally on the services side are you doing to feel good about what's embedded in the guidance?Perry WallackYes. So what I would say is, I think we did a fairly good job last quarter at predicting our services revenue, that's why we came in sort of at the midpoint of our guide. I think that what we are doing differently is we're looking more quarters out and we're saying to ourselves, what's in the pipeline? How big are the projects? What are the odds that they get delayed? And as Adam talked about just looking at client project readiness, so if and when those projects do get delayed, how do we get resources working on other projects that can fill the time or fill that void? And so, we're starting to do that multiple quarters out now.Justin Furby - William BlairAnd then just one real quick one if I can. I feel like this is the quarter where you have the opportunity to really level set, particularly Q4. In terms of booking is there really a base case framework for bookings? I know you certainly don't guide to it, but it seems like kind of an opportunity to do that, just to give a low base case. What should we be thinking about for bookings as we look into Q4?Perry WallackSo Justin, we just do not guide to bookings. So we can't comment on that.OperatorYour next question comes from Brendan Barnicle from Pacific Crest Securities.Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest SecuritiesGuys, can you give us an updated breakdown on the clients that are on recruiting versus on learning at this point?Adam MillerYes, same basic numbers about 85% on learning, 60 plus percent on performance, and between 10% and 15%, approaching 15% on recruiting. The other big change we've seen is that we now have close to 40% of our clients on three or more products, which is a pretty significant change. And I think its further evidence of the success of our core business.Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest SecuritiesSo that leads into my second question, which is despite the bookings weakness, you did notice that when you had uptick in the ARPU, per user and per client, is that all being driven by this product mix or is there some other things with pricing or anything else that are going on? Any more color you can give us on that?Adam MillerWell, I think it is a combination of three things. It's the product mix, we're selling more products and the products have higher price points. We have less competitive pressure to drop prices. And, as we go further down market we have higher price points per user, generally, just at the retail level.Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest SecuritiesAnd following up on that competitive wins, you're saying you have less competition now. We did pick up more sort of competitiveness around one or two deals. What is happening on the competitive win rate this quarter?Adam MillerOh, I think it's been very consistent, particularly in the core businesses. It's been very consistent over the last two years, I would say. The landscape is the same. There's no new competitors. We've seen a drop-off in some of the competitors, like Taleo. And we have the same partnerships that we've had before, like with Workday and with ADP and we continue to operate well in all those markets.Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest SecuritiesAnd then, lastly, I'm assuming you would have called it out if you had any, but any deals -- any eight-figure deals this quarter?Adam MillerNo eight figure, but we did have one good strategic accounts deal in Q3, Unilever.OperatorYour final question comes from Rick Sherlund from Nomura.Rick Sherlund - NomuraYou guys had mentioned last quarter that business closed late in the quarter, it was kind of anomalous. Was that -- did that prove out to be just an anomaly or did you see some of that this quarter as well?Adam MillerNo. That was an anomaly. We did not see that in Q3.Rick Sherlund - NomuraAnd the implementation delays, I understand, but the billings growth is decelerating which doesn't seem to kind of point to implementation delays as much. You mentioned that the emerging areas haven't given you what you had hoped for, but that still doesn't explain why the billings growth is slowing down. So, I guess, I'm still kind of puzzled as to, why has the billings growth decelerated as much as it has?Adam MillerI mean, essentially you have the tale of two businesses at this point. You have a core business that continues to operate well and grow at basically the same rates it's been growing at for a little while now. And you have the emerging businesses that just have not been performing in aggregate. And so, you end up with the core business still growing the way it was and the other business which was supposed to be incremental to that, not showing up. And so the billings are below expectations. But that doesn't mean that there’s anything wrong with the business overall. It just means that the newer businesses have not yet taken hold.What we've done for our part, is accept the skepticism and ourselves lower expectations over the next couple of years for those emerging businesses, while still maintaining high expectations for the continuously performing core businesses. And the net result is lower but consistent expectations over the next three years.Rick Sherlund - NomuraAdam, the stock is now selling at about four times revenues, which is pretty unusual for a SaaS company. And even if you grow 25% or 30% it's a lot faster than a lot of these companies that have been taken out taken out at 6 times to 8 times or 10 times revenue. So 6 times to 8 times revenues is up 50% to 100% from where the stock is today. Wouldn't it make sense to consider strategic alternatives at this point?Adam MillerRick, that's a good question. I think you can look at the bare case on the stock and the two points I would make are there's a take-out value that is implicit in the value of the company. There also is an expectation that if we are not growing we would significantly improve our margins which are already pretty good. We had obviously operating profit this quarter. We have for the year decent cash flow from operations around 12% cash flow margins. So, if the business were to continue to slow then we would ramp up those margins. And you're talking about a business with significant cash flow and profitability, which would ascribe a certain implicit valuation as well. We believe we can keep growing this 30% to 35% range, if not higher, and we continue to invest to make sure that happens. We also are continuously as Perry mentioned before improving both our cash flow and our operating margins over time. This has been true now for the last four years. And I think there is tremendous runway in this business, tremendous runway. We are seeing an insatiable appetite for cloud computing around the world. We're seeing a real understanding in the market for talent management solutions and the strategic value of empowering your people. And we believe we have the best team and the best product suite and the best market opportunity to capture that. And that's why we wake up every day to do the work that we do.Rick Sherlund - NomuraThanks.Adam MillerSometimes it just takes time.OperatorI am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Adam Miller for closing remarks.Adam MillerThank you for everyone participating today on our earnings call, and thank you to the Cornerstone global team for all the great work they do day in and day out. Thanks, everyone.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference for today. Again, thank you for your participation. You may all disconnect. Have a good day.")
# 2014 q4
csod.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brent Thill with "
            "UBS. Your line is open.Brent ThillGreat. Thanks. Adam, if you could just talk little about the traction inside the larger enterprise accounts and what you’re looking at this year in terms of the pipeline of opportunity. And, Perry, if you could just follow-up little bit about the FX exposure for Q1, the magnitude of that headwind? I think the guidance was certainly a little bit below where the Street was expecting.Can you just maybe walk through your approach for Q1, is there any else in Q1 from a seasonal perspective that you’re anticipating that may have been factored into the guidance you gave? Thank you.Perry WallackYes. Sure. I’ll take that first Brent. If you take a look at our seasonality over the last couple of years especially in 2014, you’ll find that the midpoint for our guide for Q1 is right in line with the normal quarterly seasonality that we’ve been experiencing.There is a little bit of headwind in foreign exchange, we have really quantified it, but suffices to say that we don’t think our seasonality is really that much from the prior years. And then, I’ll turn it over to Adam and talk about the large deals in the pipeline.Adam MillerYes. Just on the guidance point, the guidance is solely reflecting the FX hit, otherwise it’s exactly where the Street was, I think from next year perspective. With regard to the high end of the market obviously last year we did two very large deals and then we did another one at the very end of the year. We actually did multiple 8 figure deals essentially during the year, and we think that’s going to continue going into 2015.So our pipeline is much stronger at the beginning of this year for strategic accounts than it was a year ago, and we’re feeling good about our ability to compete at the end of the market with the largest best known companies in the world. And we expect to do quite well this year. But we have muted our expectations given the inconsistent results we had last year.Brent ThillRight. Thank you.Operator[Operator Instructions] Our next comes from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.Brendan BarnicleThanks. I wanted to follow-up on Brent’s question on seasonality. Perry, if I look, I mean, we’ve typically seen sequential improvements from Q1 to Q2. And we’re seeing, I mean, even the currency aside, you’re seeing a particular sequential decline. What’s the different now from what we see in the past couple?Perry WallackYes. That has to deal with the overachievement on revenue in the fourth quarter, mostly due to the execution in the services team. So, what you’ll find is that normally our Q1 is somewhere between, let’s just call it 20% and 22% of our full year. And I think at the midpoint of the guide, we’re at about 21.4% for Q1. So it’s right in line with the average or normal seasonality that we’ve had over last couple of years. The reason from this sequential decline is merely against I guess you would call maybe a little bit of tougher comp or overachievement in revenue in Q4.Brendan BarnicleGot it. Adam, in your prepared remarks you talked about focusing on the Asia-Pac business for your emerging businesses. Does that mean, you’re going to emphasize Latin America and Federal which it lagged last year?Adam MillerYes. So the investment were already made in Federal we have not reduced our investment in Federal. We just haven’t grown it. That was a macro issue. We think there could be a comeback this year, but our expectations as we’ve said before very muted until we see a change.With regard to Latin America, we are focusing only on Mexico and Brazil now, so we have reduced our investment there and we had very good results in APAC from a growth perspective. We think that’s the most promising of our emerging businesses. And so that’s where you’ll see the most investment in the emerging businesses. Of course, we’re still investing heavily in the core businesses.Brendan BarnicleRight. And then just lastly, Saba are taken private, it’s getting taking private, announcement came out earlier this week. Does that have any competitive impact one way or other for you?Adam MillerAbsolutely, I mean, it’s one last competitor in the market. We’ve had other competitors that are been acquired by PE firms. They tend to disappear into the ether after that happens. We get very good traction from recruiting standpoint is well and we’ve have seen that already in the case of Saba.Brendan BarnicleGreat. Thanks.OperatorOur next question comes from Mark Murphy with JP Morgan. Your line is open.Unidentified AnalystHi, thank you. This is a [indiscernible] sitting in for Mark and congratulations on the quarter. I just want to ask about Evolv. I guess you have Evolv for a few months now, have you started showcasing it to the customers? And if you can tell us what is the early reaction been there?Adam MillerYes. Our client base is very interesting in big data, it’s something that they been looking for. It’s the reason we made the acquisition of Evolv. It helps us both with our existing products and with new products we want to develop around predictive and prescriptive analytics. The reaction has been extremely strong. We just had a client advisory board meeting couple of weeks ago, where we had the CEO of Evolv present what we are working on and, again, the reaction was extremely positive. We have not put these new products in market yet, that will happen later this year.Unidentified AnalystOkay. Thank you. And in the same context about new products, I mean, perhaps we have heard a lot about the marketplace from the channel, good thing about the marketplace of the channel. I wanted to hear what is your longer term vision around that? It feels like investors are probably not aware of it as much as the channel is bullish on it?Adam MillerYes. We’ve intentionally not talked a lot about our platform and the marketplace. We’ll be talking about that later this year. We want to make sure we’ve fully develop what we’re working on before we bring it out to market. But expect us to make some announcements around our client conference, which is in May of this year.Unidentified AnalystOkay. And Perry is there – could you talk about the drop off in the CapEx number this quarter? Is there anything that’s going on there?Perry WallackYes. Are you talking about in Q4?Unidentified AnalystYes.Perry WallackYes. No, there’s nothing really going on there. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, CapEx last year was about $11 million and over the course of 2014 and we expected to be about $17 million in 2015 related to technology infrastructure upgrades mostly related to our acquisition of Evolv.Unidentified AnalystOkay. And the calculated billings number if you look at from the cash flow statement, I am getting around 39%. Is that mainly because that does not – not adjusting for the FX or…?Perry WallackYes. That most likely not adjusting for the FX or the large upfront payment that we received from the one client in the quarter.Unidentified AnalystOkay. Right. Okay. All right. Thank you. That’s all.Perry WallackThank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse.Michael NemeroffThanks for taking my questions. Adam, in you prepared remarks you’d said that you’re going to start to focus in a little bit more on the cross selling to the installed base. Could you just maybe give us a sense of what percent of the bookings each quarter come from the cross-sell versus new customers? And what percent of the new bookings you expect that to be from cross-sell in 2015 and 2016, just rough percentages if you would, please?Adam MillerYes. Its roughly 20% of bookings, that’s been fairly consistent for the past several years, we think there’s an opportunity to grow that and we’ve characterize that as a $1 billion potential opportunity, if you just look at the price points and the value of the products that have yet to penetrated across client base.We built the team last year really verticalized, focused on going after that opportunity, that team is firmly in place now. They are actively pursuing those opportunities and we think could provide significant upside both this year and next year.Michael NemeroffThen Perry on the – thanks, Adam. Perry on the big $4.8 million contract, what’s the duration of that contract and maybe is this a new customer or an existing customer renewal?Perry WallackYes, sure. It’s a new customer. It’s a five-year deal. What was the rest of the question?Michael NemeroffThat was it. Thanks very much.Perry WallackYes.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Justin Furby with William Blair. Your line is open.Justin FurbyHey, guys. Thanks. Adam, I wanted to ask about the 30% to 35% framework that you talk about last quarter. I think that sort of best case revenue frame work for the last two years and I know you don’t guide specific to bookings and there’s lot of puts and takes with that number, but is it fair to say over the next couple of years that sort of how you’re viewing bookings, calculate bookings as well. And I think I just ask the question, because if you look at the normalized bookings rate I think you said, it was 32% this quarter down from 35%. I am just wondering where you think that stabilizes over the next two quarters?Adam MillerYes. We don’t guide bookings. What I will say is that bookings tend to be less than revenue in the given year. And that’s been true if you go back as far as you want. The bookings percentage growth allows for higher revenue growth in the following year.Justin FurbyOkay. And then, I want ask also on the renewal, that’s sounded like you guys have another good year there. I’m just curious that the step down from 95 to 94, is that solely a function of more mid market exposure. Did you see any big 20,000, 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 type C customers that you might have lost during the year?Adam MillerNo. Our renewal rates are been very consistent over the years. The only difference is and we’ve expected this for a long time as we have more of our client base down market. You could expect there to be some incremental churn. The reality is we’ve had very minimal incremental churn despite the fact that we have aggressively gone down market over the last couple of years.Justin FurbyOkay. Great. And then one last one if I could on the pricing environment. Just curious what you saw this quarter versus maybe last year, versus the year ago from as per seat pricing standpoint and the competitive dynamics there?Adam MillerYes. So that varies tremendously by segment, we’ve seen our revenue per user continue to go up as it has over the past couple of years and we think it will continue to improve overtime.Justin FurbyOkay. Great. Thanks guys.OperatorOur next question comes from Brad Sills with Merrill Lynch your line is open.Brad SillsHey thanks guys, thanks for taking my question. Just one Adam on cross sell that metric, the 70% of customers running two or more has been gapping up nicely over the last few years. Can you just talk a little bit about during the quarter where you saw some progress in the specific modules, please?Adam MillerYes so recruiting is up to about 15% penetration. We think we are going to see some good upsell this year in connect as we release social learning and we have seen adoption of on-boarding and just across the board of our products. I think the main takeaway is that we now have 40% of our client base with three or more products and 70% with two or more products. So generally the company at large has gotten quite good at cross selling upselling products.Brad SillsOkay. Great. Thanks. And then, your comment on pipelines this year being stronger than last year in the strategic accounts. Can you just comment on where those are coming from? I guess the incremental growth in the pipeline. Are these guys’ replacement deals? Is there something going on competitively vis-à-vis some of the larger enterprise competitors, or is it greenfield or a combination? Thanks very much.Adam MillerYes the way to think about it is we have 150 strategic accounts globally. We assume at any given time maybe 20% will be active, meaning we’ll have a legitimate opportunity in play of those maybe 10% will be actively pursued during the year and our goal is to win as many of those as possible.Brad SillsGreat. Thanks, Adam.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Huang with Needham and Company. Your line is open.Michael HuangThanks very much. Just a quick follow-up on the large customer who decided to pay upfront [ph]. I am curious, what drives that customer to pay upfront? Were there any special incentives for these guys to step up like that?Adam MillerYes we had upfront billing since 2002. We used to do annual billings. We used to do monthly billing in arrears and we switched to annual billings upfront back in 2002 and we’ve been able to hold that line steadily from day one. There are – there’s nothing special about it, there’s no special incentives driving that, that’s been our policy from day one.Michael HuangOkay.Adam MillerIn the case of the particular deal that data front [ph] it had to do with the fact that they had extra cash during the end of the year and the way they operated internally and they requested it. But 99.9% of our deals are paid annually upfront and the typical deals are three year deal.Michael HuangGot you. Okay. Great. And then just with respect to the over achievement in professional service in the quarter, I was curious like what drove this? I mean was this some catch up run from Q3 or was there something else here and then just in general I think you had mentioned that deployment cycles are lengthening. I mean is this potentially offset by the success that you see in down markets?Adam MillerYes deployment cycles are lengthening only for the largest accounts and specifically we are selling bigger deals, it’s not that our deployment cycles apples-to-apples are lengthening we are now just selling much larger deals that have more complex implementations. As we go down market we’ve actually seen our implementation cycles shrink and we are able to deploy it very quickly in fact one program we’ve talked about before is one, two, three live which gets the client live literally in three weeks.So we’ve had a lot of success doing that down market. What you saw in the fourth quarter was a lot of focus on ensuring that our projects were kicked off and successful. We had a lot of clients who had objectives of getting projects completed by the end of the year often for a launch January 1st and so we did a lot of work to meet our client’s requirements. And it’s difficult to predict that on any given quarter but we’re getting better and better at doing that.Michael HuangGreat. Thanks so much.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Pat Walravens with JMP Group. Your line is open.PatWalravensOh great thank you. One sort of tactical question and that a bigger picture one. The tactical one was, Adam, if I heard you right, you said 2015 revenue guidance would have been in line with the consensus but for FX. So is it fair to say the impact for full year is $3 million to $4 million?Perry WallackThat’s right.Adam MillerYes its’ actually a little bit more than that, because it really has two pieces. It has the deferred revenue piece that’s rolling in from all the existing customers that are closed in 2000 –as '12,'13 or '14 and then it impacts the forecast of all the new sales that we are planning on doing in 2015. So if you look at the changes in exchange rates from post the Q3 earnings call to now the deferred revenue piece of that probably adds up to at least $4 million and on the new sales piece its at least a couple of million. So it’s probably north of $6 million.Pat WalravensOkay. That's helpful. And then, bigger picture, one question that I get is whether talent management is a standalone category over the long term. And so, I would love it if you could address that and then also address whether the answer is different when you look at the enterprise level versus in the SMB.Adam MillerWell my short answer is I have 2000 data points that say yes, talent management can be a standalone solution with well over 2000 clients now in the mid-market and enterprise. We think this is part of the reality of cloud software which relatively easy to integrate solutions together and so often clients will make the decision of going best-to-breed over going with an ERP solution.Now having said that, we’re not going to win every single deal. There are companies particularly at the high end of the large enterprise phase that do choose to centralize and the single solution, but we have seen time and again the ability to be extremely competitive against those ERP solutions and provide real value to our clients who are re-upping year after year. So again these are three year deals and three year renewals.And the example I often give people when they ask this question, can you have best of breeds against an ERP suite over the long time, my best data point really at the end of the day is salesforce.com which obviously is best-to-breed at sales marketing today and has performed extremely well and we think we have a very similar opportunity around managing people.Pat WalravensGreat. Thank you.OperatorThis ends the Q&A session for today. I’ll turn it back to Adam Miller, CEO of Cornerstone OnDemand for closing remarks.Adam MillerThank you all for your time and we look forward to speaking to you again soon. Thank you.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, thanks for participating in today’s program. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect.")
# 2015 q1
csod.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you. Our first question comes from Brent Thill with UBS. Your line"
            " is open.Brent J. Thill - UBS Securities LLCThanks. Adam, you mentioned that some of the new analytics capabilities that are coming, I'm curious just, when you think about being part of the quarter or providing incremental pricing on top of the quarter, how you're thinking about approaching that with your clients?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerYeah, we view it as entirely incremental. The core reporting capabilities are already available. It's embedded into the rest of the products. So, standard reporting, custom reporting and dashboards are all a free service, so any Big Data analytics are incremental to that, so Cornerstone Insights, Cornerstone View and ultimately Cornerstone Planning will all be incremental products with incremental premium pricing.Brent J. Thill - UBS Securities LLCOkay. And last year, obviously, there were a number of moving pieces as it relates to the go-to-market. And I think everyone wanted to just hear a little bit about what happened in Q1, in terms of your territory assignments, it doesn't sound like there were a lot of changes or a lot of pending changes, but you had mentioned that there were some investments in different countries like Japan and South America that you weren't really seeing a lot of yield quite yet, but it sounds like in Japan you're starting to see that now play out, maybe if you can just walk through a little bit about, a little overview of the distribution and also about where you're putting more investments and maybe where you're starting to pull back a little bit?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerThanks, great question. As I said at the beginning of the year, we are making no major changes to any of our core sales teams. So, there has been incremental growth across all the teams, but there have been no major management changes or structural changes to those teams, which is very different than a year ago. So, none of those transformations occurred this year. The reason we made the changes in 2014 was so that we would be built to last and be able to continue to grow the team this year and next year, which is exactly what happened.In addition, we said we were going to focus our efforts on the emerging areas that we thought had the most potential upside and we specifically named Asia Pacific as one of those and we're seeing very good progress in Asia Pacific, not just in Japan, but also in China, India and Australia. I think there are some other areas as well that are doing fine and we'll talk about that probably in our next call.Brent J. Thill - UBS Securities LLCAll right. Thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Your line is open.Rick Sherlund - Nomura Securities International, Inc.Yeah. Thanks. Two questions. First, any particularly large deals in the quarter?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerYes, we had a number of seven figure deals. There were no eight figure deals this quarter, but we had a number of seven figure deals with some very well-known names.Rick Sherlund - Nomura Securities International, Inc.And the pipeline going forward for the seven or eight figure deals?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerIt is solid.Rick Sherlund - Nomura Securities International, Inc.Okay.Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerSo, I think you'll see a lot of activity over the rest of this year.Rick Sherlund - Nomura Securities International, Inc.Okay, I want to go back over the billings numbers, so there was first item was an FX impact of $3.4 million, is that – most of that would be the revenue or the deferred revenue impact?Perry A. Wallack - Chief Financial OfficerYeah, that's the deferred revenue impact, that's correct.Rick Sherlund - Nomura Securities International, Inc.Okay. And then, there was something about billings rate for Q1 being less than average. What was that? Can you repeat that?Perry A. Wallack - Chief Financial OfficerYeah. Sure, that was the $2.6 million drag that was on bookings due to a little bit worse than normal billing terms in our new customers. Usually, we give color on what the average billing term or the average amount build upfront is for the new customers closed in the quarter and it was a little less than our historical average in Q1, that was really due to a couple of new large clients that have less than average billing terms. So, we haven't had that anomaly, I guess, I think it's maybe once, since we've been public. So, this is the first time we've been felt a need to give color on it.Rick Sherlund - Nomura Securities International, Inc.And what would drive that?Perry A. Wallack - Chief Financial OfficerOftentimes, there is just a couple of large clients that they shy away from our standard average upfront amount that we like to bill with the contract. It could be budgetary reasons, they could between cycles with replacing a vendor and so they just want to spread their billing terms out for various...Rick Sherlund - Nomura Securities International, Inc.Right.Perry A. Wallack - Chief Financial Officer...reasons like that.Rick Sherlund - Nomura Securities International, Inc.Okay. And then you had $4.5 million of – that was one contract where you were able to bill upfront for multiple years, is that right?Perry A. Wallack - Chief Financial OfficerThat's correct.Rick Sherlund - Nomura Securities International, Inc.Okay. And the FX impact going forward, what is the total effect that you're expecting that to have in your full-year guidance?Perry A. Wallack - Chief Financial OfficerYeah. So, as I said in the prepared remarks, we raised despite an adverse impact on foreign exchange. So, if someone tried to quantify that, what we would say is number one, we don't disclose the exchange rates we forecast with; but number two is, if you look at the $3.4 million impact that we had on our bookings not all of that is going to be recognized in 2015. So, maybe if you said $2 million or $2.5 million would be recognized in 2015, you could add that to our $1 million raise and infer that, that would be like a constant currency amount.Rick Sherlund - Nomura Securities International, Inc.All right. Okay. Thank you.Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerSure.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Adam, last quarter you talked a lot about upsell into the existing base of new modules. I was wondering, if you could maybe give us an update on how that's going or maybe some – anything quantitative around that?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerYes, I mean, the last number I gave is that 70% of our clients have two or more products, about 40% have three or more products, those numbers have held even as the installed base continues to grow and we are continuing to staff up our client sales teams around the world. So, that strategy and the potential there continue to remain very strong.Our penetration rates are going up across products and we still see an over $1 billion upsell opportunity across all products across the client base and that does not include the new products that we're announcing at Convergence including all of these Big Data analytics products.Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)And Adam, I know that there has been a lot of speculation about some of your partners specifically Workday coming into the learning management market, I think they were asked about it, curious are you still getting into large deals with Workday, is that still an active partnership at that level?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I mean, the way I would describe it as I have before is this is a field level relationship. So, our sales people match with their sales people around the world and depending on the particular region, deal and scope of that deal, we will partner together and this is true at many deals happening right now. But, I'll also mention that as a percentage of our total pipeline, Workday represents also 1%.Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)All right. That's helpful. And then, Perry, just to clarify, did you say that currency for your guide in this quarter was an additional headwind on top of the headwind that you had mentioned last quarter.Perry A. Wallack - Chief Financial OfficerYes, that's correct.Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)Okay. So, currency moved against you again this quarter, even more than what you guided to originally last quarter.Perry A. Wallack - Chief Financial OfficerYeah, that's absolutely correct, what you can see in the $3.4 million drag that we talked about on our bookings.Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my questions.Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerSure.OperatorThe next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open.Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk a little bit about a price per cheap seat changes that we're expecting from the new (35:00), as you think about the analytics et cetera? Is that kind of a meaningful uplift for you, how do you think about that? Thank you.Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerYeah. So, the analytics products get priced the same as our other products, but they are at the premium side of the range, so they are at the upper end of our per seat pricing; by contrast, the Platform is priced as a percentage of software, so depending on how much software the client has acquired, the price will be a percentage of that total bill.Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.And if you think about the Platform then, how far are you in the development process there, I'm thinking about is there going to be like an app store, you need obviously a lot of tools that you need to provide et cetera, so where are you in that process?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerWe're very far along. We're going to be demonstrating the app builder at Convergence next week and the marketplace is already up and running. We view it as four separate products. We've been working on this for over three years. This is not a new initiative. This is just something we haven't talked about, until it was ready for primetime.Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.Perfect. That's very helpful. Thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is open.Pinjalim Bora - JPMorgan Securities LLCHey guys, thank you. This is Pinjalim for Mark and congrats on the good billings number here. I wanted to ask about the Platform again, correct me, if I'm wrong, but are customers able to build apps on it and put it in the marketplace or the marketplace is actually open to only partners and customers can just use those apps made by partners? And secondly, is there any change in the go-to-market model for the Platform?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerYeah. So, the go-to-market model is the same. We're using our same global sales force to promote the Platform. We already have a number of clients set up to be beta users of the Cornerstone Edge Platform and both partners and clients can create applications and any applications made can be published to the marketplace, if people so choose. If your client developing a proprietary application for your own company, you would not put it on the marketplace, you'd just deploy it in your own portal.Pinjalim Bora - JPMorgan Securities LLCWell. Okay, got it. Perry, can we get some more color on the Hitachi deal in terms of how big was it? Or I mean is that included in the current billings or portion of it is included, any more color there? And can you update us on your plan for your quota carrying reps for the year, if you have disclosed that before?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerI'll just take that one. So, the Hitachi deal was a seven figure deal. It's a global deal. It's our first, not our first, it's actually our second big client in Japan. And I think represents us entering large customers in Japan that become the basis of a much bigger opportunity there.With regard to billings that have the normal billings that we see across our client base, so nothing unusual there and we don't typically give specifics about our quota carrying reps other than to say we have continued to grow our global sales force.Pinjalim Bora - JPMorgan Securities LLCOkay. And Adam, lastly, on the competitive front, I guess, I should ask one question on that, after Saba has been private, but from the field, we still hear that Saba is still coming up in a competitive landscape, any color there? What do you think about it? Do you think it's going to decline from here or any color is great? Thanks a lot.Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerSo, I've been in this space for a long time. And we've seen a number of competitors get acquired throughout the years and we've seen the same story carryout either immediately or over time, which is the key people leave the organization, the competitiveness and the innovation in the organization decline. And as I've said before, I view us having a more favorable competitive landscape not a less favorable one going forward.Pinjalim Bora - JPMorgan Securities LLCThank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.Brendan John Barnicle - Pacific Crest SecuritiesThanks so much. Perry, maybe you can help me with the gross margins, I'm having hard time getting to that 71.3% that you had, I mean, I'm looking at the press release at 67%, I'm adding back the stock-based comp and I get more or like something just under 68%, is there some I'm missing here?Perry A. Wallack - Chief Financial OfficerLet me just take a look. I believe that it's in the press release. And let us – why don't we skip this question for a minute.Brendan John Barnicle - Pacific Crest SecuritiesYeah, yeah, sure absolutely. Other one, Perry is on hedging strategy, I know we've talked about that the last couple of quarters.Perry A. Wallack - Chief Financial OfficerSure.Brendan John Barnicle - Pacific Crest SecuritiesAnd wonder if you guys had any update since we're kind of dealing with currency again, it looks like we may for at least a while here?Perry A. Wallack - Chief Financial OfficerYeah, sure. So, we've been evaluating hedging programs, we've been engaged with third parties that specialize in this. Most of the loss that we had this quarter, the $2.4 million was unrealized losses on foreign exchange about $1.9 million of it. You will see that detail when we file our Q. That really comes from marking to market intercompany loans and our cash balances and our air balances that are in our subsidiaries.And when you look at hedging, we are just constantly evaluating it on a quarterly basis to figure out what the right time or the right way to do it is. I think that overall, we're also looking at managing our intercompany loans and managing our international cash balances a little more optimally for the remainder of the year.Brendan John Barnicle - Pacific Crest SecuritiesGot it. And then, Adam as you think about the Platform and I know you've talked about this previously, where do you think we'll see the most common apps or the apps will be deployed in your Platform that are going to get that sort of most traction with customers?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerI mean, the early indications are obviously HR-related applications, so things like health and wellness, part time off, other types of applications that people want to do. We have clients, for example, we have one very large Swiss client that has ED applications (42:12) that they've deployed and built internally that they would prefer to port over to Cornerstone Edge. It's more scalable, it's more secure and gives them more control.So, we view there to be potentially very significant applications builds in areas like health and wellness and project management, but it's too early to tell exactly what's going to take hold. What's interesting about what we do relative to some of the other platforms that are out there. As you all know, our Platform is deployed to all employees in an organization. As a result, the opportunity for somebody building an application could really be in any area, it doesn't have to be limited to things related to HR.Brendan John Barnicle - Pacific Crest SecuritiesOkay. And is the Platform also built on dot net and does that give you sort of some special work-on relationships with Azure?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerYeah. So, the Platform's built in dot net is not really related to Azure and we have created our own coding language as part of the framework that we build to make it very easy for somebody to build an application, they don't necessary need to be a full-fledged developer. A business analyst or somebody's in this skill range would have the ability to create an application with the tools we have in the coding language we've developed.Brendan John Barnicle - Pacific Crest SecuritiesGreat. Thanks guys. Look forward to seeing you next week.Perry A. Wallack - Chief Financial OfficerSure. And then Brendan just a follow-up on your gross margin question, I think you'll find that the detailed reconciliation of that 71% is in the press release and you maybe just missing the amortization of the intangibles on the stock-based compensation. So, it's all in the press release at 71%.Brendan John Barnicle - Pacific Crest SecuritiesGreat. I'll take another look.Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerThanks.OperatorOur next question comes from Justin Furby with William Blair & Company. Your line is open.Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLCHey guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Perry, first off just housekeeping, did you say that year-over-year revenue headwind from FX?Perry A. Wallack - Chief Financial OfficerNo, we didn't really give a detail on that. When we talk about exchange rates and the impact on the current quarter revenue, what we would say is that about 30% of our revenue comes from outside the U.S. and about 90%-plus of that comes from Europe and Australia, which are the most impactful currencies.And so, if you took say a 4% movement on a weighted average basis in the exchange rates and multiply that by let's just call it 27%, which is roughly 90% of that 30% of our revenue, that's foreign. You could probably estimate the approximate impact.Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLCOkay. And just to be clear, when you gave your billings number, usually companies – a lot of times will not just look at the deferred sequential headwind, but also the year-on-year revenue headwind to get to sort of adjusted or currency adjusted, it sounds like you only made the deferred adjustments. So, in theory the year-over-year FX growth rate is actually a little bit higher than the 31%, is that fair?Perry A. Wallack - Chief Financial OfficerYeah. That's exactly correct.Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLCOkay. So, is that a couple of points maybe that you would add back or...?Perry A. Wallack - Chief Financial OfficerWe haven't really disclosed the detail, but suffice to say, there is an additional headwind.Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLCOkay. Fair enough. On the pricing side, Adam in Q1 it's still really early since the Saba take-out, but we've been hearing last year about them being sort of dumb on price in certain deals and I'm wondering if that dynamic has changed at all, if you look at deals in Q1 versus Q4 and sort of a like-for-like basis, did you see any firming up of pricing?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerIt's too hard to tell, I mean our ASPs generally are stronger and our revenue per user continues to climb. But, I wouldn't compare the volume of deals in Q1 to Q4, so it's too early to tell. Also...Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLCOkay.Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer...in Q1, we're probably already in motion before the Saba take-out, so it won't have its full impact until the second half of the year.Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLCOkay. That's fair. And then, on the rep productivity side, any color in terms of what you're seeing there year-over-year and the sales and marketing number as a percentage seems to be relatively constant over the last several quarters, despite some of the deceleration. So, what are you seeing and when do you think you'll start to see some of the leverage show up in that line, but I don't know if the guidance implies much at all for fiscal 2015?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I think there is upside in the numbers. We think rep productivity has been strong and has continued opportunities for improvement. A good example of that is obviously, rep productivity in APAC last year was very low and APAC productivity over the last six months has been pretty solid. So, we're going to see that in more of our markets. We're also being more explicit in our investment strategy making sure that we're investing in proven areas and holding off on investment areas that still needs to be proven out.Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLCOkay. Great. And then last question.Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer(47:28) on average.Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLCOkay. And one more, is there any change to the 30% to 35% framework for the core business plus a little bit of assumption on the emerging side, if you look out over next few years?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerNow, for the next year or so, I think if you go further out, international is going to be a bigger part of our business.Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLCOkay. Great. Thanks, guys.Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerThank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Samad Samana with FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open.Samad S. Samana - FBR Capital Markets & Co.Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to dig a little deeper into what's going on in the APAC region. It seems you're seeing greater momentum there, could you give us some color on whether sales cycles there are different than in your core markets, how pricing compares and whether there's a more direct deals or partner led deals?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerNo, these are all direct. It varies tremendously by region, obviously the pricing in Japan is markedly different than the pricing in India, but rep productivity is fairly similar, time to close a deal is fairly similar, you do have in some of the markets like India and China more negotiation happening post-selection than you do in other markets, but I would say, it's relatively similar and we've been talking a lot about Asia. I don't want to rule out the success we're having in Europe.We continue to see a very strong opportunity in Europe across all markets we've grown that team very significantly over the last 18 months. And I expect there to be good returns on that investment over the remainder of the year.Samad S. Samana - FBR Capital Markets & Co.And then one follow-up, as you think about where you want to invest in sales capacity, where do you see the greatest need, is it in APAC, is it in EMEA or just largely across the board?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I'd say it's pretty dispersed. We're looking at building all of our teams. Again, we're not overinvesting in markets that we're not confident about yet. So, we're being pretty cautious about those markets. By contrast in markets where we feel like we're doing well, we've invested fairly heavily.So, again in Europe in some of our vertical market opportunities like healthcare and down market particularly in the mid-market we're seeing a lot of opportunities. So, we're growing all of those teams again because of the changes we've made in 2014, the management, infrastructure, and the structure of the organization is right and ready. And so, it gives us really good ability to consistently grow these teams now for the foreseeable future.Samad S. Samana - FBR Capital Markets & Co.And last question from me, does the company have or plan on building out a data center in the APAC region?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerAt some point, yes.Samad S. Samana - FBR Capital Markets & Co.Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.OperatorOur next question comes from Alex Zukin with Stephens. Your line is open.Alex J. Zukin - Stephens, Inc.Hey, guys thanks for taking my question. Adam, I wanted to ask you kind of a two-part question on the competitive environment. Part one just on the effect on sales cycles, if any from kind of the newer initiatives out of work on SAP on learning side and then anything to make out of kind of the potential for Workday to launch a product around, maybe freezing the market for some buyers that you're seeing out there or is that just something you're not seeing?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerI mean I could address them both at once, which is to say that none of the announcements over the last several months have had any impact on the overall market. And the broad assumption is that all of these companies will have a learning system. We are the best-of-breed solution in the market. We dominate the learning management market globally. And as we will unveil at Cornerstone next week, we continue to aggressively innovate in that area.Alex J. Zukin - Stephens, Inc.That's helpful.Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerAs (51:29).Alex J. Zukin - Stephens, Inc.Understood. And then just one follow-up, are you seeing any push from clients in the industry to kind of address the broader HR spectrum, you're seeing some alliances in the marketplace between certain vendors. I'm just wondering what your take on that is in the marketplace?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I mean, I assume, you're referring to the IBM/SAP alliance that was announced. The reality is, IBM integration services, has been integrating Brassring and Kenexa for many years now. They have done the same thing with SAP's products for many years now. These are not really new initiatives they're just new press releases.So, I don't see any major difference in the market from that perspective. I will say as we've grown and we've become one of the largest cloud computing companies in the world and the dominant player in talent management. We now have alliances with all the Tier 1 system integrators as well. And so, in many ways, it neutralizes that as a threat in the market and allows us to compete at a level playing field.Alex J. Zukin - Stephens, Inc.Got it. Thanks guys.OperatorOur next question comes from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Your line is open.Pat D. Walravens - JMP Securities LLCGreat. Thank you. So, a tactical question for Perry and then a bigger picture one for Adam. Perry, can you tell us roughly what percentage of revenue services were in Q1 and how that compared to Q4, because I seem to remember last quarter, you called it out being a bit different?Perry A. Wallack - Chief Financial OfficerYeah. Sure. I mean, as I said in the prepared remarks, we usually run roughly about 80-20 and this quarter was no different, it was a little bit higher on the software side; whereas in Q4, it was a little bit lower on the software side. So, it never varies by more than let's just call at 1% to 2.5% on each line item per quarter.Pat D. Walravens - JMP Securities LLCOkay. That's not very much. And then, Adam I'd love to hear your thoughts about how the cloud market might be changing particularly with all the commentary that we've been seeing about how the giants like Microsoft and Google might be looking at acquiring the leader in the space salesforce.com, what do you see is going on there?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerI think there is a widespread recognition at this point that cloud is the future of software and all software companies will be cloud computing companies. So, what we're starting to see is they're not that many companies with the scale that are left in the cloud computing marketplace, especially given the acquisitions by SAP, Oracle; and in fact, Salesforce over the last few years. So, every major tech company is going to need some presence in cloud computing to survive over the long-term.The other transformation that we're seeing is all big cloud companies will also become Big Data companies. So, we're doing it so is everybody else. It's part of the benefit of being a cloud computing company, which is that you have access to an enormous amount of data, which then can be analyzed through machine learning and ultimately monetize, which is what we're now doing.So, we have the advantage of being one of the few cloud computing companies in the world at scale. We continue to grow aggressively at this point, over 19 million users and we see opportunity to continue to expand all over the world. There is no geography or vertical that were kept out of it at this point.Pat D. Walravens - JMP Securities LLCThank you. And maybe if I could follow-up on that, as you enter into the platform-as-a-service space, it seems like that might bring you more into competition, with people who you normally wouldn't like Salesforce who obviously got a really good platform-as-a-service offering, how do you see that playing out?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I don't really view it as competitive with force.com, I think people are using force.com aggressively. We use force.com internally for a lot of our applications, a lot of our services. We obviously also have the Cornerstone for Salesforce application.By the same token, I believe that the large enterprise software companies need to become platform companies or also will not be able to survive. So, you have to be a cloud company, you have to be a Big Data company and you have to be a platform company. We are now all three. And I think with our subscriber base, with our scale and our ecosystem, are in excellent position to continue to succeed in the future.Pat D. Walravens - JMP Securities LLCGreat. Thanks guys.OperatorOur last question comes from Brad Sills with Bank of America. Your line is open.Bradley Sills - Bank of America Merrill LynchHey guys, thanks for taking my question. A question on what you're seeing with regard to new customer wins and the different components of the stack. Are you seeing certain combinations with learnings, whether it's learnings plus succession and compensation that you're seeing more momentum and recently maybe just a little bit of color on kind of where the combinations of the different modules. How that looks today versus where it was a couple of years ago? And then are there certain modules that you're seeing some momentum and that could potentially become increasing contributors to that cross sell.Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerYeah, learning has always been and remains a strong asset for us. But, we're seeing every combination of products being sold into the market today; on average, we're seeing two or three products being bought upfront and what's notable is that we're starting to see more and more full suite deals, not just in the mid-market, but even amongst the largest accounts in the world.Bradley Sills - Bank of America Merrill LynchOkay. Okay. Great. And then just a question on the different sales forces or different sales organizations, enterprise versus mid-market, did you see any strength in one versus the other this quarter given the refocus on both of those?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerNo, they're both performing, I mean, enterprise has been the core sweet spot of our business for a long time and remains at. So, we saw very good traction in the enterprise market. At the same time, we're seeing good uptick in volume in the mid-market both in the U.S. and in Europe.Bradley Sills - Bank of America Merrill LynchOkay. Great. Thanks, Adam.Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerThank you.OperatorThis ends our Q&A session for today. I'll turn it back to Adam Miller, Chief Executive Officer for closing remarks.Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerThank you all for your participation and your questions. And we look forward to seeing many of you at Convergence next week. Thank you.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, thanks for participating in today's program. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect.")
# 2015 q2
csod.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorOur first question comes from Brent Thill from UBS. Your line is open."
            "Brent John Thill - UBS Securities LLCThanks. Adam, maybe if you could just talk a little bit about – if you could talk a little bit about the large deals in the quarter, and you mentioned the eight-figure deal, and how you're thinking about that pipeline as you go into the back half. And for Perry, just if you could talk about the flow-through of those transactions throughout the year, that'd be helpful.Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerYeah, so we are seeing a really strong enterprise pipeline, and in particular, I think over the last 12 months or 15 months, we've demonstrated our ability to do very large deals working with the largest companies in the world, around the world. So these deals, as you know, have taken place, not just in the U.S., but internationally as well. So we're feeling very good about our ability to compete at that level and we've demonstrated an ability to win deals that are eight figures and many that are in the high-seven figures, and we see a continued ability to do that going forward as well.Brent John Thill - UBS Securities LLCAnd, Adam, I know it's early with the new platform development capabilities and analytics, but it seems like you're taking this to a different strategic level, your ability to interact with the end buyer. Can you just comment about perhaps how this is – early stages kind of changed the conversation and realize that again, it's still early in terms of that formation?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerYeah. That's exactly right. I think we're now on our third phase of evolution. So we started life as a single applications company. We then moved to become a suite of applications company. And today, we are now a platform company, and that message is resonating very well. We have a well-baked Big Data strategy that is being executed very well. In addition, as you know, we've introduced the Edge platform which provides for openness and extensibility and in effect, we've future-proofed our applications. So that message and that positioning is resonating very well in the market and I think is giving further comfort to these very large clients that we are the right choice for them and we're able to meet their needs, not just today, but into the future.Brent John Thill - UBS Securities LLCThank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.Brendan John Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities LLCThanks so much. Adam, great job on Latin America and the public sector. One of the other areas you talked about that have been sort of a struggle with Asia-Pac and in your comments, you mentioned as you traveled across Asia that you saw more demand. Any changes or improvements on execution in that portion of the business?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerYeah. I mean we talked about APAC last quarter, which is why we didn't bring it up again this quarter, but we're seeing really good penetration and momentum around the world. So we're now seeing success not only in Europe, but also throughout APAC and in Latin America. So our global strategy is coming to fruition now and we're seeing the ability to sell truly around the world. The application today is in 42 languages. The system is in use in 191 countries and we have direct sales and service operations now in dozens of countries, which has given us the ability to really service these markets in a way that we simply couldn't even 18 months ago and while we had challenges last year in getting these new initiatives off the ground, those investments are now starting to have real returns.Brendan John Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities LLCSo just to summarize, the areas last year you identified were Latin America, Asia-Pac, public sector, and I think was it SMB? And it sounds like you've talked about certainly three of those. Is the fourth one also – should we assume that's taken care of as well?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerWell, the fourth one we said wasn't going to be impactful this year either way, and that remains true. I think SMB is more of a 2016 story for us. We'll probably talk about it a little bit next quarter. In addition, the fifth one was strategic accounts and obviously, you've seen now over the last few quarters we've been able to secure the largest companies in the world and that's continued, including in Q2.Brendan John Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities LLCTerrific. And then just lastly, you mentioned with the Novartis deal, the verticalization that folks are looking for; are you having to develop more verticalized products as you go forward in these larger, more strategic accounts?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerAbsolutely. So life sciences is a great example of that. In life sciences, there's an FDA requirement called CFR 21 Part 11 that requires validation of environments. There was a lot of resistance to cloud computing in life sciences. Obviously Viva has done very well in that space, but what we're talking about impacts a manufacturer of pharmaceuticals and we've shown an agility to meet the needs of those specific markets, which gives us a real competitive advantage. So we've done extremely well in life sciences over the last few quarters. We've similarly done well in healthcare over the last few years and we're seeing the ability to also compete in other markets, like as I mentioned, in the earlier comments, education, and nonprofits. So each of those markets have some nuances in regard to how you position, in regard to the kind of content and messaging required, but also with regard to the product features themselves and we've had the ability to innovate and tailor our solutions to give a holistic solution for those individual markets, and that's given us real competitive advantage in those spaces.Brendan John Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities LLCTerrific. Thanks a lot, guys.Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerThank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open.Harris Reid Heyer - Barclays Capital, Inc.Hey, guys, this is Harry Heyer on for Raimo. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you might be able to dig a little bit more into how – a little bit more into customer reception of the analytics product. And it seems, honestly, digging more into this emerging business unit, a theme that a couple of other guys have asked about already, it just seems like a very dramatic tone reversal from even, call it, six months ago. So I was hoping maybe you could provide a little bit more color on what specifically you've seen from customers on a product acceptance front that has – it just seems like not that long ago, you were discounting them very, very heavily and now it's a source of strength. So just any more color around that would really be helpful.Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I wouldn't call this a tone reversal. What I would say is that, as we indicated previously, we made a number of different investments over the last 18 months and some of those investments required a gestation period to start to have returns. We are now seeing momentum almost across the board from those investments. We talked last quarter about our strength in APAC. We talked, obviously, earlier today about our success in Latin America. We've shown over the last few quarters the ability to sell to the largest companies in the world and we've had a pretty run in education and nonprofits. So we're seeing good success in many of these areas and I think we've proven out that not on a quarterly basis, but on an annual and certainly on a medium-term basis, these investments made a lot of sense and will continue to make sense in the future.Harris Reid Heyer - Barclays Capital, Inc.Great. Thanks.OperatorOur next question comes from Patrick Walravens with JMP Securities. Your line is open.Patrick D. Walravens - JMP Securities LLCOh, great. Thank you, and congratulations to you guys.Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerThank you.Patrick D. Walravens - JMP Securities LLCHey, Adam, on Cornerstone Edge, investors, I think, are pretty familiar with Force.com and how that helped Salesforce really dominate CRM. How is Edge similar and how is it different?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerWell, I think it's very similar in the fact that it allows us to open and extend the platform. It allows our clients to begin to integrate easily with other solutions. It allows our clients to extend functionality in certain areas, and like Force.com, it allows third-party developers to build applications on our infrastructure, leveraging our ecosystem. So in all those ways, it's very similar. I think the primary difference is we have the benefit of hindsight, so we understand where they ran into challenges along the way. We understand where there might have been architectural decisions at the beginning that needed to be changed later on, and we're able to learn from those mistakes, but maybe most importantly, we're starting with a base of 20 million users. And our products, as you know, impact every employee in an organization, so there's a wider breadth of potential applications that can be both built upon and integrated with Edge.Patrick D. Walravens - JMP Securities LLCThat's helpful. Thanks. And is it generally available at this point? When did it go GA?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerSo it's in beta right now.Patrick D. Walravens - JMP Securities LLCCan you tell me...Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerIt'll go into GA early next year.Patrick D. Walravens - JMP Securities LLCOkay. Thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Sorry, I joined a little bit late. So, Adam, I'm just kind of curious, we've seen a lot of HCM vendors recently doing well that lead with payroll, and they seem to be taking some share in the market and growing pretty fast, companies like Paycom and Paylocity. I'm just curious, is payroll something that you would consider building or adding to the portfolio in the future, because I get the sense the partnership with – partnership outside of the one with ADP with some of these smaller payroll-centric vendors might be an issue since they're trying so hard to get into the HCM market. I'm just kind of curious what your thoughts are on that?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerYeah. So specifically those companies have done very well in what we would consider the SMB space, which is really sub-500 employees; in some cases, very low in the SMB space, so what some people call the VSB space, very small business. We are very comfortable with the relationships we have in the payroll community. As you know, we work with many of the largest payroll companies in the world. Many of them are clients. We have a very tight relationship, as you know, with ADP, which is the largest payroll company in the world. We have regional payroll relationships, and we think it makes sense to continue the kind of collaboration that we have with those companies. Having said that, we will also collaborate in the SMB space, so as we'll talk about more in the future, as we build out growth addition and bring higher level of focus to our SMB operations, we will also leverage the relationships we have in the payroll world to piggyback on the success that those companies are having in the small business space.Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)That's helpful, Adam. If I may, a follow-up for Perry; Perry, just looking out a couple of quarters and you have couple of large prepayments in Q4 and Q1, I'm just curious how you're planning to fill those holes? Are those going to be filled with large contracts that you see that are coming down the pipe that could close in Q4/Q1? Or were you just going to – you think you're just going to grow right through it?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerMichael, let me take that one first. We are doing a lot of very large deals. That one was an anomaly. We are very transparent about billing terms. That one was clearly exceptional in its upfront payment, but many of these large deals also have delayed billing terms, and they tend to offset each other over time. As we have more of these large deals which not only have transpired but also are in the pipeline, we believe you'll have a net effect between delayed billings and where there's been some upfront payment. As you know, there's really been just one major case where there was a significant upfront payment at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. That will definitely be offset by significant unbilled backlog that we have going into next year and beyond.Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)Great. Thanks for taking my questions.OperatorOur next question comes from Alex Zukin with Stephens. Your line is open.Alex J. Zukin - Stephens, Inc.Hey, guys. Congratulations on a great quarter. I wanted to ask you about the attach rates that you're seeing for some of the other modules, like recruiting. Are you seeing an uptick there? And what's driving it? And then just, Perry, I wanted to ask you to maybe dig in a little bit to the gross margin guidance for the rest of the year; what's kind of driving that?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerYeah, so today, over 70% of our client base has two or more products. Over 40% have three or more products. And so we're seeing good attachment of all products. We have a particular focus now on recruiting and onboarding because we've done so well in the areas of Learning and Performance, we think the attachment of recruiting and onboarding furthers our penetration and stickiness in those accounts and are consistently looking to bolster the unified talent solution. In addition, I think all of the investments we're making around analytics further the strength of that message because the analytics solutions obviously are even more powerful, the more of the platform you're using. And so to the extent you're using not one or two, but five or six or seven of the products, you get much better capability from the analytics tools around visualization, predictive analytics and ultimately, work force planning.Perry A. Wallack - Chief Financial OfficerYeah. Thanks, Adam. Alex, to answer your question about the gross margin guidance, what we've seen this year so far is that we've been adding head count in all of our services teams, really just as scheduled. We've had a little bit of an increased spending associated with the third-party subcontractors that we use for our implementations. And we did make a very, very heavy investment this year in our network infrastructure, which is primarily to support the platform and the analytics initiatives that Adam's been talking about. When you look at it just in net, the sum total difference between the prior year and the current year, it's probably no more than about 100 bps. But as we initially thought it was going to be up a couple of points, we felt like we needed to just let everybody know where we would be coming in versus that prior-quarter guide. So just about 100 basis points at most, less than last year and roughly the way we're viewing it is due to some investments that are really period costs for this year.Alex J. Zukin - Stephens, Inc.Got it. It sounds like that could modulate back up as we look out.Perry A. Wallack - Chief Financial OfficerThat's correct.Alex J. Zukin - Stephens, Inc.Thanks, guys.OperatorOur next question comes from Samad Samana with FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open.Samad S. Samana - FBR Capital Markets & Co.Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First, Perry, on the full year guidance, that net margin guidance suggests that OpEx in absolute dollars will only see small increases in the back half of the year. Is this because the company feels comfortable with where you are in head count? Or how should we think about the ramp in expenses in sales and marketing and R&D for the back half of the year?Perry A. Wallack - Chief Financial OfficerYeah. So I'll let Adam speak to the ramp in the head count when it comes to sales and marketing. I think overall, what we're looking at is that we have front-loaded more of our expenses for the first half of the year. And yes, you are correct that it does imply that for the second half of the year that does ratchet down a bit to that full year net loss. The last thing that I would add to it is foreign exchange can still move around. So far this year, we've obviously had a net negative impact. Obviously, we could have some of that turn around in the second half of the year potentially. Adam, you want to add to that?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerYeah. I mean, with regard to staffing in general, we are exactly on track to our head count plan for the year which will continue to have investment through the latter half of the year. In addition, we are seeing very good demand around the world. And so we remain very bullish about our ability to continue to expand our sales teams globally.Samad S. Samana - FBR Capital Markets & Co.Great. And then one follow-up, if I could. So at the beginning of this year the company somewhat reallocated where it was going to focus its investments, more in its core markets where there's better visibility. With APAC and Latin America starting to see better signs and public sector as well, how are you thinking about that investment framework for growth for the back half of the year and as you start to think about 2016?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerSo we think about it the way you might think about an investment portfolio. We are taking a very conservative approach to allocating our investments across all these different initiatives to ensure that we have a balanced approach to growth in areas where we know we will have return, combined with growth in areas where we think there's potentially significant upside.Samad S. Samana - FBR Capital Markets & Co.Great. Thanks for taking my questions, and nice quarter.Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerThank you.Perry A. Wallack - Chief Financial OfficerThank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham & Company. Your line is open.Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLCHi, Adam and Perry. I would certainly echo the congrats on the really strong quarter.Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerThank you.Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLCA couple of questions from me. One following up on the last gentleman's question is, Adam, how are you seeing the sustainability of the Latin America and public sector opportunities over maybe the near to medium term? And I ask the question because you've had some kind of starts and stops in those segments historically.Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerYeah. So the jury is still out on government within public sector but we are seeing really good momentum in education. And I think that is not a one-time event, we're seeing consistent momentum there, and consistent growth. Latin America, there weren't starts and stops; this is the start, and so we think there's plenty of room for upside. We are just now starting to get momentum. We are just now starting to build out pipeline, teams, capability, brand awareness and ultimately, reference accounts that will allow us to continue to grow throughout the region. Scott, as you know, we have a very particular strategy as we enter into a new geography, we want to be conservative about our opening in the market. We focus on developing relationships with marquee accounts and then leverage those marquee clients to expand in the region. And that's exactly what we've done here in Latin America. I think it took longer than some people might have liked, but in the scheme of things, it actually didn't take that long and now we're seeing real return in that market. And we'll continue to grow and expand in the region.Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLCOkay. And I guess a question on the overall sales efforts; you obviously went through some reorganization in your teams last year that we've all talked about a couple of times. And while your results were really strong in this quarter and certainly over the first half this year, would you characterize the sales team as hitting the productivity levels that you're expecting or is there still some opportunities to improve the strong execution that we've seen recently?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerI think they're in line with some historical averages at this point, but we believe that there's room for upside, absolutely. We can grow productivity, particularly as we enter new markets, and some of our newer teams still have room for upside. Absolutely.Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLCGreat. That's all I have. Thanks for taking my questions.Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerThank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Brad Sills with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.Brad Sills - Bank of America Merrill LynchHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on a very nice quarter.Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerThank you.Brad Sills - Bank of America Merrill LynchI just, Adam, had a question for you, please, on analytics insights. I know it's limited view here since it's been out but can you give us, provide just a little bit of color on how the installed base or even new accounts are receiving insights at this point in the lifecycle of the offering?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerYeah. I mean, it's working as we expected, which is the primary attraction is the high end of the market. Our largest enterprises obviously have the most data and potentially the most to gain from predictive analytics, and so we've seen very good interest from that segment of the market. They're the ones that were very involved. In fact we sold out of our beta. We wanted to keep it capped, and it's had very good momentum there. We also believe that it's helped us in our overall positioning. So both platform and Big Data in selling to large enterprise are things that people care about and give them comfort about our ability to serve them not just today but into the future. And as you can imagine, if you are a Global 100 company, when you're making a purchase decision, you're doing it not for even the first term of the contract; you're assuming you're making a decade long commitment, if not longer and therefore having the ability to service our needs not just today, but into the future is incredibly important and we've now proven an ability to do that.Brad Sills - Bank of America Merrill LynchGot it. Great. And you provided us some nice color on the larger accounts. Could you provide a little bit also on the midmarket? How did that organization fare this quarter and where do you feel you are there? Is there – as you guys gain more success up market, is there potential de-emphasis on the midmarket or is that not the right way to think about it?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerNo. I wouldn't think about it that way. I mean I absolutely view this as a portfolio approach and so midmarket is a very big market opportunity for us. As you know, we divided midmarket into what I would consider upper and lower midmarket, and we think there's significant opportunity there. We are bolstering our partnerships in that segment. We are building out further capability in that segment and continuing to grow our sales teams in that segment, and I believe there's plenty of room for continued growth over the long-term in that market.Brad Sills - Bank of America Merrill LynchGreat...Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerAlso it is important to recognize that the enterprise wins help us in the midmarket because these are the best known brands in each of these verticals and so the success we've had in meeting the needs of these largest clients are also what these smaller companies aspire to be like, and therefore our solutions are very attractive to them and obviously prove that we could scale to meet the needs of these smaller businesses that are less complex than these global multinationals with bigger needs and bigger requirements.Brad Sills - Bank of America Merrill LynchGot it. Great.Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerSo we don't view it as an exclusive opportunity. We view it very much as a symbiotic relationship between those teams and we're seeing good growth in both segments.Brad Sills - Bank of America Merrill LynchThat's great. Thanks, Adam.OperatorOur last question comes from Justin Furby with William Blair & Company. Your line is open.Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLCThanks, guys. Adam, I wanted to start on the pricing dynamics this quarter. I'm just curious whether you've noticed any evidence of some of the other players, Saba or the like, that are starting to get a bit maybe more firm on pricing and deal cycles? And also I would like an update in terms of the cross-sell efforts and what that looked like in Q2, with that team, was there any noticeable improvement there?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I'll take the second one first with regard to cross-sell. We're still in line with our historical averages. We think that is, as we've discussed before, an opportunity for future upside and we put teams in place to specifically address potential up-sell for our largest accounts. We've taken a dedicated approach to cross-selling, up-selling the biggest accounts that we have and given the success we've had with large enterprise, there are many of those accounts in our client roster.With regard to the competitive environment, I'm not sure what do you mean by Saba firming up its pricing, but that would be news to me. We've continued to see our competitors very aggressively try to compete with us on price, but as our solutions become more specifically relevant to individual markets and verticals, we are having an increasing ability to hold our price points and we think there's some upside there, as you know, relative to other SaaS verticals, so companies operating in other application areas outside of talent management; the talent management market has significant under-pricing relative to the rest of the cloud computing world, and so I think the long term, there is plenty of upside from pricing specifically.Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLCGot it. And there's – I want to go back to the public markets. There's been some chatter about from some of the partners around federal, particularly as it's potentially opening back up. I guess, can you give any update there? Remind us when you go back a few years ago, what was that as a percentage of your business? And could it return to something like again this year in theory?Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerYeah, a few years ago, it was probably 5%-plus of our incremental sales. And I think it absolutely could be that into the future, even as we expand more internationally and domestic revenue becomes a smaller percentage of total revenue. But it remains to be seen when that timing will be. So I can't tell you it's going to be this year that it's back up at 5%, but I do believe over the long term, there is a very big opportunity there and in federal in particular, we have advanced our FedRAMP status ahead of all of our competitors, and that puts us in a very nice position over the long term.Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLCGot it. Thanks, Adam. And then, Perry, just quickly on cash flow, we haven't seen it this low since IPO and I'm just wondering if it's solely DSO driven or if there's anything else there? And then on the sales and marketing side as an expense it hasn't really come down as a percentage of revenue, I'm wondering why that is and whether you think that happens in the second half of the year or when you start to see leverage there? Thanks.Perry A. Wallack - Chief Financial OfficerYeah, sure. So on the cash flow front, what I would just say is that we, as I gave in the prepared remarks, are sticking to our guide for the full year, and so it's just really timing. What I would also add is that we've talked about some of the operational changes that we've made in the business and smoothing out cash flow, and we were pretty pleased with the impact that those had in the second quarter. So versus our internal targets for cash flow, we were very, very pleased. As you know, we don't give cash flow guidance on a quarterly basis, and so it's best looked at still on an annual basis. While we are making progress in smoothing that out throughout the year, I would just continue to focus for the short term on the full year number.Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerAnd just on sales and marketing in particular, I would tell you that we often do our sales hiring in the first half of the year, and so you don't see the productivity of those reps until the latter part of the year, so that does have an impact of margin throughout the course of the year.Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLCOkay, great. Thanks, guys.OperatorThis ends the Q&A session for today. I will turn it back to Adam Miller, CEO, for closing remarks. Go ahead.Adam L. Miller - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerThank you, all, for joining the call, and we appreciate your participation. We'll speak to you again next quarter. Thank you.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's program. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect.")
# 2015 q3
csod.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator Instructions]Our first question comes from a Mark Murphy with"
            " JP Morgan. Your line is open.Mark MurphyYes. Thank you very much. Adam, I'm looking at the sequential change in deferred revenue of $16 million, and it's actually the biggest number ever. If I just exclude the seasonally stronger Q4, historically, it is the biggest number ever. So, it seems as though there is a lot of strength being reflected on the balance sheet. And you did call out a number of new logos that sounded like very, very large global organizations. So I think what I don't understand is Q3 is usually actually a very soft quarter for enterprise spend. And so I'm just wondering how did you overcome the seasonal softness there? And maybe could you comment at all on how you feel about the enterprise pipeline for Q4 and beyond?Adam MillerYes, thanks, Mark. We are having a very good run. This is obviously a continuation of a run we've had for a long time in the enterprise segment. As you know, we have been able to push higher up into the enterprise segment, working with the larger and larger multinationals along the way. And the net result of that is strong bookings growth and also, I think, the ability to work with the biggest companies of the world. So that doesn't just speak to prior quarters, but also our ability to be perceived as real options for other big companies down the line into the future. We've seen that a little bit with some of the bigger deals we've done. As I've mentioned before, we think there's opportunities to do that in the future as well. And the only challenge with all of that is those big projects also have big implementations. And as a result, you often get variability in the implementation resulting from those projects, but they do all go live and it's just a matter of timing.Mark MurphyGreat. I wanted to ask you as well, just a quick follow-up on the platform side, we've heard a lot of feedback that you're – essentially, you are future-proofing the entire suite in a way that kind of sets you apart from the rest of industry. And so, could you remind us when is the GA expected or maybe put a finer point on that? And just how confident are you in hitting that milestone? But I think more importantly, do you envision your competitors who lack that platform capability perhaps experiencing a bit of a competitive setback or just having a tougher time next year, just given how much interest there seems to be in your platform before it's even released?Adam MillerYes, we have two advantages there. One obviously is the unified nature of the suite that we have today, which is – we organically built all of the products in our platform. The second is the ability to future-proof that both with our big data initiatives that I talked about, specifically the rollout of predictive analytics with Cornerstone Insights and the ability to visualize and plan around the data with you and Cornerstone Planning. In addition to that, we have the Edge platform which allows us to open up our platform to the entire ecosystem, and that's something that is a long-term project. It's well underway. We have pieces of that coming out in the near term, and we have the broader platform capabilities coming out over the next two years; will be phased out. One of the first areas we are focused on is the integration center. And I think what's truly unique about what we're doing relative to many of our larger competitors in this space is the open nature of our platform. The fact that we're opening up all the APIs, we're using a service-oriented architecture that's open and we are working with our full ecosystem on making it very easy to use Cornerstone alongside or integrated with other software solutions that are in the market.Mark MurphyThank you.Adam MillerAnd that's been very well received.Mark MurphyThank you.OperatorOur next question comes from a Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.Michael NemeroffHi, guys. Just to kind of follow up on Mark's thought, the bookings have been pretty strong. Specifically, how much did this eight-figure deal affect the services revenue in the quarter? Do you feel like you are giving yourself enough coverage on your guidance? Because this has happened before.Adam MillerI mean, unfortunately, it's happened before, and we try to get more and more conservative about this. As you know, the revenue came in over 99% of what we had forecasted. But we need to have 100% accuracy. So those deals are difficult to predict. In that particular case, the client was ready to kick off and then a week later delayed the project by enough time that it missed that milestone for revenue recognition in the quarter. – happen for these large deals, and so we're doing a few things to offset that. The first is the creation of a dedicated strategic delivery team to work with these largest clients that we haveThe second is more operational control around all of our service revenue. And the third is tying the kick- off of those projects to the sales process. So, we had in the past had two distinct processes. First, you would obviously try to get the deals done, and that's where the salespeople were involved. And then you would proceed to kick off the implementation. What we are now working on is tying those pieces together so that by the time the contract is signed, it's already been agreed when the kickoff would take place. And it gets documented, making it more enforceable and easier to forecast.Michael NemeroffThat's helpful, Adam. And just to clarify, Perry, the guidance that you provided, the tightened-up guidance, I think in your prepared remarks you said that we should expect that currency tick is going to continue to be a headwind. Just want to confirm, is the new guidance that you provided – is that with the currency impact that you told us to expect included in? Or are we going to come back in Q4 and you are going to tell us that revenue would have been $3 million or $4 million higher because of it?Perry WallackWell, no, we obviously bake that into our forecast. Obviously, you can only do it to a certain extent based on what the exchange rates are forecasted to do in the quarter, but it is included in that guidance.Michael NemeroffOkay, great. Thanks very much, guys.Perry WallackThank you.OperatorOur next question comes from a Brent Thill with UBS. Your line is open.Brent ThillThe – just going back on the bookings for the quarter, Adam, Perry, I just want to be clear. If you take the services issue out, was the bookings where you guys wanted to see it in the third quarter? I guess if you could just talk about what you are seeing as you roll over. Are there any deals that slipped from Q3 to Q4 that you are expecting that -- you always have deal slips, but anything else unusual that you saw that moved around in the quarter?Adam MillerNo, if you adjusted for that services slip, A, we would have beat revenue, and, B, the bookings would have been even higher. So we had met our expectation as to where we thought we would be. And, unfortunately, that one project had a pretty big impact.Brent ThillOkay. So it was only one project, not a string of projects.Adam MillerIt was really one implementation predominantly that impacted it.Brent ThillOkay. And just as a follow-up from the last question, the recurring services issue, I think, has caused some investors some heartache. And is there a way that you feel that you can extinguish this going forward, or is this just something that we all have to be braced with that's just an inevitable part of the model when you think about how you are giving the guide?Adam MillerI think there's a few things there. Number one, we have been working with our auditors to be able to disclose in our SEC filings the split between software and services. We will be able to do that beginning in Q1 of 2016, so we are very close to being able to disclose that specific split. As Perry said, it's roughly 80%/20%, but we want to be very specific about it. That will help. The operational things we're doing will help. The tying – to the sales process, I think, will give us greater assurance about what's happening. And as we grow down market, we have less variability because we are less a victim of the success we're seeing up market as a percentage of total revenue. And obviously, we're trying to incorporate this into the way we think about forecasting services specifically. So it's all of those things, but it's a multifaceted operational exercise, and we're looking at all aspects of it to make sure that we are successful.Brent ThillThanks for the color.Adam MillerThank you. Just one other point there, as Perry mentioned, it's not just us. This is something that all cloud companies are facing that deal with large-enterprise deployments. And it's a tricky problem, but something that we have a lot of experience with. And hopefully we will get better and better and better at predicting. We've gotten pretty good at predicting it; I do want to highlight that. I understand we came in under the revenue number, but it's slightly under. We were very much in line overall with where we thought we would be. We were better than expected in bookings. The challenge is that sometimes when you're dealing with these really large deals, one deal could throw off the number in a one or 2-percentage point perspective, and that has an impact obviously on the overall results.Brent ThillThanks.OperatorAnd our next question comes from a Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Your line is open.Pat WalravensGreat thank you. Adam, I guess I have two questions. The first is I would love to hear a little bit more about the opportunity you see at the low end of the market in SMB with the new product. And then secondly, now that Workday has introduced Learning, how do you think about whether it makes sense for Cornerstone to expand into other areas like maybe payroll or core HR?Adam MillerYes, let me take those in order. We are launching our new Growth Edition product at the end of this month. We are very excited about it. We basically have built a new product from the ground up and have taken into account all the technology changes and consumerization expectations that happened at the low end of the market. So we have built a product that is truly mobile first in design, entirely self configurable, leveraging everything we know about learning and performance management, and can be deployed by the client themselves within three hours.So this is dramatically different not only from our existing SMB product, but from all of the major SMB products in the market today and our space, and we think could be extremely successful. We are working now with a number of potential partners because there's no way we can ourselves get all 100 million seats in the SMB space. Remember also that the price point here is about 4 times the price point for enterprise, so the per-seat value is very high. To the extent we are able to do this not just ourselves, but through third parties like some of the big payroll companies we already work with, there are really big opportunities here for that segment. So we are very bullish on it. Something we put a lot of effort into over the course for the year. You didn't see the return on that this year. It's an example of something that takes some time before you get the return. You'll start to see the return on that next year.Pat WalravensOkay.Adam MillerWith regard to the second question on Workday, I think two points there. One, Workday doesn't even, by their own admission, have a product ready for market for another year. And then it will be a V1 product. We have been doing this now for 15 years. We have extensive experience in the learning management and are able to deal with the newest ways of doing training, but also the tried-and-true old ways of doing training and development. And this is a complex field. There are a lot of differences by industry and by geography, and the iterative process that we have gone through with our clients can't be replicated in a short period of time. So we are very comfortable with our leadership position in the space.We do think there’s an opportunity for us to keep expanding our definition of talent management. And what is needed beyond talent management for companies that are trying to manage their people, we will talk about that more on future calls. But suffice it to say that we think we're in a very good position in this area, and we are continuing to grow our footprint with our platform.Pat WalravensThat's great. Thank you.Adam MillerThank you.OperatorOur next question comes from a Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest. Your line is open.Brendan BarnicleThanks, so much. Adam, I just wanted to just clarify to make sure I heard right your commentary about 2016. Did you say you are planning on getting sales and marketing down to under 50% revenue for the year?Adam MillerThat’s right.Brendan BarnicleOkay. And also, you said growth rate that would be equal to what we've seen this past year.Adam MillerYes, I think we can stay in the same range that we have been growing at. And as we've said before, we think we can do that not just next year but into the future.Brendan BarnicleTerrific. And then if we look back last year, you guys identified some emerging areas that were more challenging in Latin America, the Pacific Rim. You had, I think, the public sector. The small business, you just talked about your handle a new small business solution. And you certainly – I heard some logos of some Latin American companies. Can you just comment on those? I think you had five a year ago that you talked about where we are in those individual markets.Adam MillerA year ago, we said that these were nascent markets. We called them emerging segments for us that had relatively new teams that were building out in those markets. We said we were going to invest upfront, but it was going to take some time before we got the return. And now we are starting to see the return in all of those segments. Latin America obviously doing very well over the last couple of quarters. APAC, or Asia-Pacific, doing quite well all throughout this year, we have seen mixed results in the public sector. I think federal has still been somewhat disappointing for us. But we have had success with the rest of FLED [ph]. And SMB, we have viewed as really a two-year initiative of products coming out the end of this year. Maybe we get a little benefit at the end of the fourth quarter, but this is really a 2016 story. And the last, the fifth, being strategic accounts, which we believe will show really good returns this year. So we've had success in all of those segments. We said it was going to take some time. We have gotten that time and those teams are now performing.Brendan BarnicleGreat. And then just -- Perry, just one for you on FX. You talked about some of the headwinds we see in the fourth quarter. As you look out to next year, though, presume if rates stay where they're at, should we – are we right in assuming that you should basically see no FX headwind as we look out to next year?Perry WallackYes, I think that everything resets at the end of this year. We will be giving more specific guidance, obviously, after Q4, and we will have to see exactly where everything is. But they only can go against us for so long and for so far.Brendan BarnicleAnd any different thoughts on implementing more of a consistent hedging strategy?Adam MillerYes. We have looked at it, and there is a certain level of complexity that we haven't wanted to digest yet in the business versus the limited level of benefit that it would provide to us. But we have – we've engaged a third party and we've got everything laid out. And we constantly reassess on a quarterly basis. If you noticed this quarter, the actual drag in the PNL was only about $66,000 in the realized and unrealized loss for foreign exchange. It's just that so far this year, we are well over $3 million.Brendan BarnicleGreat. Thanks a lot.OperatorOur next question comes from Samad Samana with FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open.Samad SamanaHi, good afternoon. A couple of questions. Coming back to next year's outlook, could you give us some color on the expected contributions from the more emerging/nascent growth opportunities versus the core enterprise business? Basically, how much do you need to maintain that 30% type of growth next year from these newer areas?Adam MillerWe are not really thinking about the business emerging versus core anymore because those businesses aren't really emerging anymore. We have seen success now in those markets. They've had time to gestate, and we are seeing results around the world. We often think about things with regard to geo, so we think about the Americas as one business unit, EMEA as the second and APAC as the third, and we will often operate our business alongside that from an investment perspective. SMB obviously has the opportunity to provide uplift next year. We don't really have significant expectations for that right now just given our historical results in SMB. But if the product proves out the way I think it could, we could have significant upside there.We are also again seeing real ability to do well up market, and that extends beyond just strategic accounts. I would also characterize that as part of our enterprise business. There are some very large enterprise deals that we do in the U.S. and around the world that are not considered part of those 150 strategic accounts. Yet, we view our capabilities up market as being very key to our continued growth, and we are seeing success all year long in that segment in very large accounts, in multiple industries and multiple geographies. So, overall, I would say we have growth opportunities in all segments, and we will continue to look for increased sales productivity across the board.Samad SamanaThat's helpful. And then one more. It looks like the trailing four-quarter ARPU was down sequentially and was effectively flat year over year. Could you comment on how much of this is due to success in the enterprise where ARPU might be lower versus any changes in the pricing/discounting environment?Adam MillerI would say that generally we've had a pretty consistent ability to raise price over time. That comes from a combination of the number of users that are different segments of our portfolios. So, whether it's up market or down market, as we have said many times before, down market we have much greater price per seat then we do up market. So if you were talking about literally the biggest companies in the world, they obviously get volume discounts that small business would not get. So the price point difference is fairly dramatic. The other is the number of products that we are able to sell per account. And we have been able to sell more products, so our ARPU goes up from that perspective. And then lastly, our revenue per user goes up when we discount less. And because of our relative strength in the market, we have been able to discount less. We also continue to train our sales force on how to effectively negotiate and hold price in competitive situations.Samad SamanaThat's helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.Adam MillerThank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Brad Sills with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.Brad SillsHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just one on the success you are seeing in the enterprise segment. Any changes to the competitive environment there, or is it still a big greenfield opportunity that's driving adoption? Or have you seen a shift from greenfield more to replacement type deals?Adam MillerYes. We’ve always said that enterprise is not entirely greenfield. In the enterprise segment, most of our – most prospects out there have a learning management system. It might be an on-premise legacy system if they have one. Most have an applicant tracking system. Again, it might be a very old one, but they have one. And they often have some customized version of a performance management system often, again, on premise, usually customization of an ERP system they had in the past. What we see as a greenfield opportunity is the ability to go in and replace all of those systems in one fell swoop, and we've done that now many times. We're doing that with enterprises around the world across geographies, and we're doing it at scale. So these are not small businesses; these are the largest companies in the world. And they are looking for unified talent management. They are looking for a solution to effectively manage their people and help their people to realize their potential. And because they are interested in that unified talent management solution, this is why we are so bullish on analytics. Because if they are using us to manage every aspect of their people, it also makes very logical sense to extend that to include making predictions about those same people and being able to visualize and plan around the data relative to those people.Brad SillsGot it, great. Thanks. That's very helpful color. And then on the SI channel, if you could comment a little bit, please, on how that's tracking. You signed some pretty big global SIs over the last couple of years. Maybe just some commentary on how that channel is ramping would be helpful, please. Thanks.Adam MillerYes. I would say at this point, we work with all of the major SIs in some capacity or another. In some cases, we have very formalized global partnerships. In others, it's more informal or even potentially regional. We have different success with different partners in different markets. So, some are influencers in certain geographies, some are very significant influencers in certain verticals and others focus on particular segments.But I would say the SI ecosystem that we have today is world-class and is influential in most deals that we do this point. So whether, they are helping inform us about the opportunity at the account, or they are somehow involved in the selection of the system, or they partner with us to do the deployment or change management resulting from the project, or we become part of a larger transformation project that perhaps they are doing, we’re getting validation from all of them and that really helps us grow the business. It's one of the reasons we have been so effective with the large enterprises.Brad SillsGot it. Thanks, Adam.Adam MillerThank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Justin Furby with William Blair. Your line is open.Justin FurbyHi guys, thanks. Sorry I joined late. A question on Europe, and then I've got a follow-up. Adam, Europe seems to be a lot of activity. And I'm curious when you look out over the next two to three years, do you think the mix of your business will look a lot more Europe-centric than it does today? And it also feels like there is maybe more efficiency going on in Europe. I would love to hear if you look at the U.S. versus Europe in terms of productivity, what that looks like. And I've got one more. Thank you.Adam MillerI would say the mix will shift to be more and more international, not specifically more and more European. So Europe has represented about 30% of the business now for the last several years. And I suspect it will stay at 30%, but international will move from 30% to much closer to 40% and beyond as we continue to grow out APAC in Latin America.Justin FurbyOkay, and then – sorry go ahead.Adam MillerAnd then in terms of productivity, I would say you do see a little more market maturity. I wouldn't necessarily call it sales maturity, but market maturity, in that you do see more European buyers buying full-suite talent management. Whereas, you will often see in the U.S. still companies willing to buy one part of the suite. So, just focusing on one pillar or one aspect of talent management. We see the same thing happening now in APAC and in Latin America, a willingness to really reevaluate their talent management strategy and look for a solution management people holistically.So we are having a lot of success in Europe, in Asia and in Latin America because of that. And the strength of our platform, our specialists focused on talent management, really gives us competitive advantage in that kind of environment. So I think you'll see the business continue to shift to be more and more international over time.Justin FurbyGot it, that's helpful. And then the midmarket – just coming back from HR tech, it feels like that's maybe an area where maybe it's a little bit more challenged. And I don't know if they are more focused and taxed on ACA, if there are other dynamics there. But are you guys still investing when you look towards the next couple of years in that market in terms of incremental sales adds? And just general, I would love to hear how it performed in Q3 and what you think going forward there. Thanks.Adam MillerYes, as you know, we spent a lot of time and effort going down market for a long period of time now. Particularly, down from enterprise is what we would consider midmarket. And over the last two years, we essentially segmented midmarket. We bifurcated it into what we would call upper midmarket, essentially national accounts and the lower midmarket major accounts. We have built out both of those teams. So we've made a lot of investment in that area, and we think there's room for improvement. I mean, We can continue to grow productivity in that segment. We are adding more channel partners in that segment specifically and building up our pipelines in that segment, specifically to drive more volume and more growth in that market.Justin FurbyGot it.Adam MillerWe're still bullish on it. We've got hundreds and hundreds of midmarket clients today.Justin FurbyGot it. And then you may have addressed this and somebody may have asked it, but in terms of the sales productivity and looking out to next year, just in general, when you look at some of the other companies in the space, I'm just curious why you think maybe your sales and marketing is higher relative to the growth rate. Is that a market dynamic? Is that just -- just any color there would be helpful. Thanks.Adam MillerI think some of it was the investments we made over the last two years, which required us to seed the market. Obviously, we've all talked about this. It may have been beneficial for us to phase out those investments over time instead of doing them all at once. Because we did them all at once, we get the benefit of it starting now. But there was a lot of expense with no near- term return for a couple of years. Now that's changed. We've also learned our lesson. So, going forward, we will be phasing out our investments. We won't be making them all simultaneously, and that's why we are confident we are able to drive sales and marketing expense down as a percent of revenue.Justin FurbyGot it. Thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Raimo Lenschow from. Your line is open.Raimo LenschowThanks for taking my question. Can you talk a little bit about what you see in the federal sector? I remember it was just Q3, and that was a couple of years ago one of the big focus areas. Any update on that one?Adam MillerYes. For us, it's still been somewhat disappointing. We did not have significant results in federal in Q3. So, despite our bookings over-performance, it was not a result of federal. We didn't have any success last year in federal in Q3 either, so it's relatively consistent. But we are making some changes there. We are continuing to build out the success we've had a couple of years ago in federal to ensure that we have a very strong client base in that segment, and we will continue to operate in that segment. We also were very close to finalizing our Fed ramp certification, which is something that will be relatively unique in our space. We are at literally the final stages of approval and may have a one- to two-year advantage in having Fed ramp certification before anybody else in our space, which is meaningful in that segment.Raimo LenschowOkay, thank you. And then the follow-up question for me was – on the midmarket initiatives that you mentioned, obviously you talked about partners, but there will obviously be investment needed. How does that fit in with the lower sales and marketing costs?Adam MillerNo, we've made the investments. The investments have already been made. This is a matter of realizing the investments that we've made and getting the returns that we expect from the segments, including on the partner side.Raimo LenschowOkay, perfect. Thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Alex Zukin with Stephens. Your line is open.Alex ZukinHi guys, thanks taken my question. So, Just going back on the top-line growth, is it possible to get some sort of color – is it fair to assume that if you back out the services, that maybe the subscription revenue growth was at least a few points higher than what you posted in the top line? Any color there would be helpful.Adam MillerWe really don't break it out that specifically. We give the color that our software versus services percentage runs roughly at 18% and 20%. And so we probably just leave it right at that. As Adam said, we are – we are working toward being able to disclose the specific, exact percentages in Q1 of 2016. And if I gave a little bit of color on it, what I would say is that our subscription revenue was higher than what we had expected in the quarter.Alex ZukinGot it. That's helpful. And then you guys talked about earnings profitability in 2016. And I guess first question just is that for a quarter, or are you talking about for the full year? And then maybe you can dig in around the lower sales and marketing and contrast that with how you're thinking about hiring sales reps in 2016. Because it's – you guys are talking about a very high growth rate, 30%, for not just next year but the year after that. And I'm wondering are you going to be able to hire with 15% type of growth in sales and marketing?Adam MillerYes, so first of all, we are talking about full-year non-GAAP profitability. We think we already getting fairly close to that, and it’s time to move over the line. So, we are forecasting full-year non-GAAP profitability next year. With regard to how we get there, the number one opportunity is the lower sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue while still growing the sales team. So how you do both? You have to leverage our data to make decisions about where and when to allocate incremental headcount for the sales team. So, that’s both from a global perspective. So, what part of the world? And from a segment perspective, so what team or vertical to put them on.Secondarily, we think there are opportunities to keep driving down our overall operating expenses and improve our gross margins. And so, we have recently brought in a former McKinsey partner who was focused on an operational excellence practice to run our operational excellence initiative. And we are continuing to invest in several areas to drive automation process improvement, change management and more effective utilization of our personnel across the board to drive profitability.Alex ZukinGot it. That’s helpful. And maybe if I can just squeeze one more in. Adam, can you talk about the pipeline for large deals in the fourth quarter and maybe compare and contrast it versus this time last year?Adam MillerThe lawyers never like when I answer that question. But suffice it to say that we have seen very good pipelines in the large-enterprise segment, including strategic accounts.Alex ZukinPerfect. Thank you, guys.OperatorOur last question comes from Scott Berg with Needham & Company. Your line is open.Q - Unidentified AnalystHey, Adam. It’s Harry. I will leave it to one question. We will make it quick. And congrats on the continued bookings. Adam, the question is for you is we talked extensively in August about some of the process improvement changes and where you can gain those efficiencies like you just recently commented on. How much can those improvements and what you are doing with platforms simplify or make implementations of these large-scale projects go faster to maybe help reduce some of the variances that you saw in the quarter with this one deal? Or will the variance in that one customer – it’s customer-specific that the changes just won’t impact in making that more predictable?Adam MillerGreat question, so we literally just kicked off an initiative to reduce the time to implement our average enterprise implementation by 50%, which will in fact help with forecasting all types of enterprise implementations, including the largest ones. And there are process improvements we can make to make the timing of those projects more predictable. So we are very much looking at every aspect of our operation to enable Cornerstone to operate with world-class standards across the Board.Unidentified AnalystGreat. That’s all I have. Congrats again.Adam MillerThank you.Perry WallackThank you.OperatorThis ends a Q&A session for today. I’ll turn it back to Adam Miller, Chief Executive Officer for closing remarks.Adam MillerThank you to everyone for joining the call, and we look forward to connecting with you soon. Thank you.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s program. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect.")
# 2015 q4
csod.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Pat"
            " Walravens with JMP Securities. Your line is open.Pat WalravensGreat, thank you. First of all, Perry, congratulations on your 16-year run that’s really remarkable and enjoy the time off.Perry WallackThank you.Pat WalravensAdam, congratulations on a strong quarter. I like the free cash flow guidance a lot. I think people are going to be a little disappointed by the revenue guidance. And so I guess the first question I would ask is are you seeing any signs that the macroeconomic concerns people have are causing customers to slow or delay spending and is that something that you baked into the guidance for the year?Adam MillerNo, not at all, I mean we really guided based on two things. One, we want to be conservative. Obviously, the market is a very jittery these days. Our multiples, along with everybody else’s have compressed. And as a result, we thought we should be conservative going into the year. And number two, we have been beat up multiple times by foreign exchange. As you know, about a third of our business is already international and that percentage continues to increase. So we wanted to be extremely conservative about FX going into 2016 and for the full year.Pat WalravensOkay, great. And then secondly, just broader, can you give us an update on your platform as a service solution and whether that’s something that’s going to kick off a product cycle for you guys this year?Adam MillerYes. So we are very focused on the Edge integration center. So there are two components of Edge. One is the ability to open the platform, which is integration center. The other is the ability to extend the platform, which is the app builder. With after talking to lots of clients about Edge, it is very clear that the immediate focus is opening the platform, make it easier to integrate Cornerstone into other products from other vendors. This is something that will speed up development for us because we often spend time working on integrations that will now be in the hands of our clients and our partners. They will be able to do the integrations themselves. It also lowers our costs associated with integration of services, because almost every deal we do will have anywhere from one to five integrations as part of that deal. We do the services work for that. The Edge integration center is going to allow us to automate all that service work. So we are very focused on integration center and we will be showing it in May convergence.Pat WalravensGreat. Thank you.Adam MillerThank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is open.Mark MurphyYes. Thank you. Perry, congratulations. There has truly never been a dull moment and it’s been very inspirational, I am sure your family is terrified by this, but – and I don’t know if they can handle it, can they handle it, but I really do wish you all the best.Perry WallackThank you very much. And I would say terrified and excited. And the only thing that I would add is Adam and I have been talking about this for a while. It’s obviously been a phenomenal, phenomenal run. He and I have kicked off a search to really find a world-class CFO with a tremendous amount of experience and scale. I am going to be here as long as necessary to ensure a smooth transition and someone who is world-class takes over the reins. So we are feeling really, really positive and excited about the upcoming year. And like I have said, it’s been a great 16 years.Mark MurphyWell, that’s great to hear and thank you for filling us in on that plan. So I wanted to start with this. I noticed that if we ignore the noise of the long-term deferred and instead look at the short-term billings that, that actually accelerated to 30% growth. And so it’s remarkably consistent with the trajectory a year ago and so it’s actually the – it’s the strongest Q4 sequentially in terms of billings growth that you have had in the last 4 years for a Q4 and so I guess I am just wondering, part A of this, from your perspective, was it – was there an unusual sort of explosion of the larger deals just based upon the logos – excuse me, not the logos but the characterizations of the clients that you added and also, does that short-term billings growth help give you confidence in your growth targets for 2016?Adam MillerYes. I will answer both of those. The second question, the answer is definitely yes. It sets us up very well for 2016. And with regard to the scale of the deals we were doing, just to put this in perspective, we did as many million dollar-plus deals for this first year contract value in 2015 than in all previous years combined. So since the inception of the company which as you know is 16 years ago. We also did more deals over $500,000 in 2015 than in the first 12 years of the company, so more than we did in the last decade. So the transaction volume and scale has gone up dramatically and we saw that very clearly in the fourth quarter.Mark MurphyOkay, great. I wanted to ask you just as a follow-up. I noticed it looks like you obtained FedRAMP status very recently and if I have interpreted that correctly, you had already won some business within the federal government I think years ago, I think before you had that authorization. So I am just wondering does this change the opportunity set materially or could you just speak more broadly to your federal government opportunity?Adam MillerYes. So we have done fairly well on the services side in federal. We have maintained all of our clients. We have full implementations of all of our clients are all referenceable, and we have a very nice federal client base. But as you know, we have not sold much new in federal over the last couple of years. FedRAMP definitely opens the door for us. We got authorization last week. And we are the only ones in this space that are now FedRAMP certified and that is a big deal to federal agencies. So that puts us in the driver seat now going into this year. And I am hopeful that we will see a change in trajectory now in federal government sales. We have changed out the leadership of that team and we think we are well positioned now going into this year.Mark MurphyOne last one, if I may. I wanted to just ask you, Perry, the other question in my mind. When you look back at 2015, is there any way you can characterize the overall impact of anything that changed in terms of billings, so I think you could have deferred billings, you could have billings with a shorter than usual duration, I think you – conceivably, you could have ramp deals just where the project occurs and faces and so the billings might come in smaller chunks over time. So I am just trying to understand, is the success with the larger transactions caused anything different in terms of the optics – of the billings optics in 2015?Perry WallackYes. Sure. So great question, as you said the very, very large deals do not have necessarily the level of upfront billings than the rest of our business. And so what happens as a result of those deals is that we do have delayed billings or what we say around here is we have some in the tank, if you will. And when you look at the average billing term in the fourth quarter and you compare that to the weighted average over the past 3 years, it was slightly less than the last 3 years. And so if you normalize for that, it would have added a couple of extra points to bookings growth.Mark MurphyThank you very much.Perry WallackThank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham & Company. Your line is open.Scott BergHey Adam and Perry. Thanks for taking the questions and first of all, congrats on a fantastic quarter. And Perry, I know you will be missed on these calls very much by all the participants. So good luck on the retirement, and we certainly wish you well.Perry WallackThank you.Scott BergA couple of quick ones for me, Adam, as you talk about the large deal environments, this is something you have been talking about for a couple of quarters or the expectations of improvements on a year-over-year basis, can you maybe talk about the impact of partners that they maybe having on the larger deals that are coming into the – into the company today or is it really more driven by your direct sales force?Adam MillerI think at some of both, so we have scaled up our sales teams at the enterprise level and our strategic accounts team. We have very tenured seasoned reps in those segments. And we have experienced now working with these very large companies. So that gives us an advantage in these deals. But without a doubt, the work we have done over the last 2 years with top tier system integrators has definitely helped us in these large accounts. In some cases, it neutralizes the playing field. In other cases, it actually gives us an advantage. As you know, we now have [Technical Difficulty] partnerships with Accenture and Hewitt and most recently, IBM as well as with Deloitte and Ernst & Young, so we are working with all the major Tier 1 partners and that has made a difference in our ability to sell off market. And it is a little bit of a chicken-and-egg situation. Part of the reason we have gotten these strategic relationships is because of the success we have had up-market. We are working with their platinum accounts. And as a result, they need to be working with Cornerstone. Of course, once they are working with Cornerstone, it makes it easier to get more of those very large deals.Scott BergGreat. I guess when you look at the large deal success in the fourth quarter, how would you characterize your pipelines going into the first half of ‘16? I think, there is a little some concern on did you pull the entire pipeline to make for a great quarter or is this something that’s going to be sustainable going into next year?Perry WallackNo. I have said this on the prior call. My view is that the largest companies in the world are themselves like a vertical. So, in the same way we have done very well in verticals like life sciences and healthcare and banking, we also are now doing very well in vertical of the largest companies in the world. And that’s given us the ability to sell more of them, we have referenceable accounts, we have anchored clients and we have the ability to sell around the world. As you have heard me say earlier, we are not just doing this in the U.S. This is a global opportunity for us and we are winning these very large accounts all throughout the world and that will continue.Scott BergGreat. And one last quick one for me, on the analytics opportunity, you are now a solid year into the above acquisition. We continue to hear a lot of demand right now for analytics around different HR applications and the Evolv or the influx products from Evolv certainly are generating some interest. Can you talk about how that application is or that product is playing out in the market today relative to your expectations from the release earlier this year?Perry WallackYes. So, what we have been doing with Evolv since the acquisition, which was a year ago, is focus on building out not a product, but a suite of products. The coming out party is in May at Convergence and we will be releasing three brand new products: Cornerstone View, which is data visualization software; Cornerstone Insights, which is a predictive analytics tool; and Cornerstone Planning, which is a full workforce planning system. All three of those are getting released next quarter and will be generally available starting at our client conference in May.Scott BergGreat. That’s all I have. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats again.Perry WallackThank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Brent Thill with UBS. Your line is open.Brent ThillThanks. Adam, I just wanted to go to the customer number and net new customers down almost 35% year-over-year from the fourth quarter. And I just think it speaks to what’s going on with the sales productivity that issue that you have talked about historically. Can you bring us up to speed? And were you happy with that number? Is this now just tilting to larger contracts? So that number is really – maybe it doesn’t look as bad on paper as we think when you look at just the number. Can you just help reconcile that?Adam MillerYes. So year-over-year, we are down 15% in terms of net new client adds and that’s the result of two different factors. So, the first is obviously our focus going up-market has been true, not only in enterprise and strategic accounts, but also in every segment. So, even in the mid-market, we have been working on bigger deals. And as a result, you get more dollars, you get higher ASPs, but you sacrifice some of the units. It’s just the reality of how it works. Having said that, we are not seeing the productivity out of some of our mid-market teams that we would like to see and so we expect some improvement going into 2016 in those areas. So, specifically, major accounts, national accounts, there is opportunity to drive incremental units. It’s part of why we did a global agreement with ADP, it’s part of why we are working on other deals related to partners addressing that mid-market segment, because we think it is a very big opportunity for us. And we are doing well with the larger deals in those segments. We just want to supplement that with units as well. In an ideal world, you get both. You get both the larger ASPs, the bigger deals, the multi-product deals and the units and that’s really what we are focused on at this point.Brent ThillOkay. And Perry, there have been a lot of questions from your investors to me just as it relates to the guidance for ‘16, I am just curious if you could highlight what FX impact you put in there? Is there – I think Adam mentioned that you have been a little more conservative. The last two quarters, you have obviously missed the revenue guidance range. So, I was just trying to understand, is there something that’s changing the methodology what you give to Wall Street now going forward relative to what’s happened in the guidance for the last two quarters?Perry WallackYes, absolutely. I mean, when you look at the exchange rates from the end of the year until now, it’s been the GDP in the U.S. dollar, there has been a decline of about 6% to 7%. And when you look at our entire revenue base for 2016 and approximately a third of that is foreign and in the functional currency of our UK sub. When you do that math, it’s north of probably $6 million, $7 million, $8 million, that’s the impact. So, we have taken that into account and feel pretty conservative about our guidance.Brent ThillOkay. But Adam, you are not pulling back from your aspirations of 30% growth?Adam MillerNo, I am not. I mean, that is the objective. People are worried about what our annualized bookings would be this year. As you can see, we had strong bookings for the full year and that heats us up well we are going into next year. I mean, what Perry just talked about, we are being very conservative. And if you look specifically at the change in the foreign exchange rates from November 5 when we did our last earnings call, until today, there is a massive drop in that exchange rate as the dollar strengthened. And so if you just recalculate the same expectation from last earnings call to today, you will see that it has a major impact on what the revenue guidance would be. So, it’s entirely attributed to that piece. And we don’t think foreign exchange impacts the performance of our work reflects the performance of our business. Our business is doing extremely well and the change in foreign exchange is not reflective of the performance of the company overall and that’s what we are really trying to articulate here.Brent ThillGreat, thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.Michael NemeroffHey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Perry just won’t be the same without you. That’s all I am going to say.Perry WallackThank you.Michael NemeroffI just have a question. If I can put my pessimistic hat on and just assume 90 days from now, the macro-economy doesn’t go as swimmingly as I think, Adam, you think it is going to go. Would you be willing to readjust the profitability targets for the year and not chase the growth and let a little bit more fall to the bottom line and since just stop the spending as much to chase that 30% bogey?Adam MillerYes. So, the short answer is yes. I do want to highlight the fact that we are talking about a 7 point improvement, 700 basis points improvement in operating margin to get to what we are guiding, which is $1 million in non-GAAP net profit. So, we are putting a lot of things in place to drive operational efficiency, whether that is business automation to gain leverage in G&A or it’s more efficient implementation services and lower outsourcing of service work to drive cost of sales down or most importantly everything we are doing on the sell-side to improve our sales and marketing expense as a percent of revenue. All of those things bring us to profitability. To the extent we slowdown more, we will raise that number even more. So, we will have even greater improvement. And again, we are being conservative in everything we are talking about today. So, there is even upside in margins and specifically in free cash flow for the year.Michael NemeroffThanks. That’s helpful. And then on the revamped small business product, I was just wondering maybe you can give us an update on where that stands now and what we should expect from that on the contribution side in 2016?Adam MillerYes. So the product came out in November, on schedule and it looks amazing. Anybody could download it and play with it, its Growth Edition is available on the website. There is a free trial available. And it is mobile-ready and it’s self-configurable. It can be deployed in three hours and is game-changing for that sector. Its contribution for this year is still assumed to be relatively small as we ramp up. We are ramping up partnerships for Growth Edition. We are ramping up our sales team for Growth Edition. And as a result, we don’t have high expectations for that this year, but I think over time, it will become a meaningful contributor to the business. And we view it as addressing 25% of the available market globally. So it’s an important play for us.Michael NemeroffThe large contracts that you signed this year can you give us a sense who was the incumbent that you took business away most from in 2015?Adam MillerYes. I mean as you know, our number one competitor without a doubt is SAP. And most of the largest deals, we either replace SAP or one of their legacy products or we beat SAP head to head in the finals.Michael NemeroffGreat. Thanks very much guys.Adam MillerThank you.OperatorThank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brad Sills from Bank of America. Your line is open.Brad SillsHey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just one on the sales and marketing efficiency leverage that you are expecting this year, can you describe a little bit the initiatives underway to generate that, is it just better productivity in the mid-market, larger deal sizes in the large enterprise and then any discussion on kind of hiring plans there as well?Adam MillerYes. So I would describe it as a four point plan to achieving more efficiency in sales and marketing. So the first is obviously driving greater productivity of the sales force that we have generally and that is done through better on-boarding and enablement and training of the sales people as well as hiring and retention of the sales teams that we have. The second is around the sales compensation plans. So we have realigned our commission plans to provide potentially more upfront cash for the reps, which does impact cash flow, that’s already in the numbers that we described. But by the same token, it lowers our annual expense related to those commissions, which have gone up over the last couple of years. And we will get more leverage each year after this year as those plans go fully in effect. Remember, our commission plan, our multi-year plan and so they have a 3-year impact over the course of the next 3 years. We will see increasing leverage as the old plan phases out and the new plan takes over entirely. The third piece there is better allocation of headcount. So our incremental headcount is being better applied based on the productivity of the teams. And so for example, as we just talked about, we are adding less to mid-market and much more to enterprise, where we are seeing really strong success. Lastly, all of the expenses associated with sales are being more tightly controlled, whether we are talking about T&E or incremental support and services or overall marketing expense related to how we are selling. All that being closely analyzed to make sure we are driving efficiency.Brad SillsGot it.Adam MillerThis is not a theoretical exercise. These are very specific initiatives and plans that are being put into effect, many of which have already been put into effect for this year.Brad SillsGreat. Thanks for the color.Adam MillerThank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.Trevor UptonHi, this is Trevor Upton on for Brendan. Thanks so much, guys. The billings have been stronger than expected in the last couple of quarters, while revenue has been a bit weaker, last quarter there was the eight figure deal that slipped into Q4, is there anything with these larger deals that are causing implementation delays or anything like that?Adam MillerNo. I mean, as we have talked about on prior calls, the large deals do create more variability in the service revenue. And in particular, you had a two-pronged [indiscernible] relates to specifically the timing of the implementation, not just how long it takes, but when it starts and when milestones are achieved. Because with these very large deals, you have multiple parties involved, it’s not just us and the client, it’s often teams of people on the client side as well as many third party consultants working on behalf of or with the client. So you end up with different timelines than you would have in a typical enterprise deal. In addition to that, the accounting rules with these larger deals sometimes cause a reallocation of anticipated service revenue to software revenue as part of the overall accounting rules and that results in a lengthening of the recognition period for that service revenue. So instead of it being recognized over a relatively short period of time, it gets amortized over the life of the agreement.Trevor UptonOkay. And has any of that been a surprise and kind of an impacting in the reported results versus the guidance?Adam MillerThe main impact on Q4, without a doubt, is foreign exchange.Trevor UptonOkay. And then if I can ask a quick follow-up with the sales and marketing growing to 40% of revenue over time, should that be linear, kind of the 300 basis points or so basis points a year?Adam MillerNo. I would expect we would be able to do it faster than that.Trevor UptonOkay, great. Thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Samad Samana with FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open.Samad SamanaHi. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted a follow-up on the formulation of guidance, so there is going to be a lot of change. It sounds like with some in sales and then with Perry retiring. Congrats on that, Perry, by the way. But there will be a new CFO. As you think about how you have evaluated the funnel for 2016, how comfortable do you feel that even with all of these changes that are anticipated that you have baked in enough conservatism, could you comment on that?Adam MillerYou mean just with the sales funnel in general, the pipeline?Samad SamanaYes. I mean with the guidance, there is going to be a lot of changes in the company both in sales and at the CFO level I guess I am curious how you still have as much confidence in guidance given the last couple of quarters?Adam MillerYes. So with regards to sales, I would not say there is a significant amount of change. In fact, we are extremely stable with regards to our sales force. Management is fully intact. The teams are all in place. We are not adding significant numbers of new teams this year. And that gives us tremendous stability throughout the sales organization. So I – while we are being more careful in how we are allocating expenses in sales, that does not mean that there is significant transformation or change within the teams that we have today. And then with regard to the finance team, I can let Perry add to this as well. But Perry obviously have been my partner from the beginning and so we will remain friends, remain partners. But as it relates to the finance organization, we have a large finance organization with extremely talented professionals all the way up and down the chain, and that is firmly intact.Samad SamanaGreat. And then one follow-up, so someone touched earlier on the number of net new customers and how that was down a little bit. As you think about 2016 and beyond, how do you think about the growth framework contribution from up selling into the installed base versus adding new customers across the spectrum?Adam MillerWe have not forecasted any significant change in what our up-sell rates are relative to the installed base. However, as we said before, we believe there is significant upside in that area. And we have increased the size of those teams because we believe there is tremendous opportunity within the client base. This is particularly true given the growth in our product footprint. So over the last couple of years, including what is coming out in May, we have essentially doubled the product footprint that we have at Cornerstone and that gives us tremendous up-sell capability in the installed base.Samad SamanaGreat. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats again Perry on retirement.Perry WallackThank you.OperatorOur last question comes from Justin Furby with William Blair & Company. Your line is open.Justin FurbyThanks guys. Perry, congrats brother. I wanted to ask a couple of questions. First on the guidance, I want to make sure I understood that, Adam, did you say for fiscal ‘16 that on a constant currency basis, you are guiding to 30% growth meaning that the currency is the entire delta or did I miss that?Adam MillerNo, no, no. We are trying to maintain the growth trajectory that we have had. We have been able to do it now for a couple of years and we will continue to move in that trajectory. We are obviously being conservative. And on a constant currency basis, we have been very close to 30% and we have been and we will be.Justin FurbyGot it. That’s helpful. And then on the mid-market, I was just curious can you give us a sense for how big that is I forget. I know it’s not as simple as that you’ve got teams like the federal, IRI etcetera, but rough numbers as a percentage of your business, what is mid-market and can you give any sort of feel for directionally? This is like you have got two very diverging growth rates within enterprise and mid-market. Can you talk about some of the things there or how you think about ‘16 in terms of those two business units? Thanks.Adam MillerYes. Well, first, I would say as a percentage of total revenue, it’s declined as we have become more international. So, as our teams in APAC and Latin America and EMEA continue to expand, the total contribution of the Americas and the U.S. in particular goes down. Secondarily, as we have continued to grow in the large enterprise and strategic accounts and down-market, you also have a shrinking of total contribution by mid-market. Having said all that, we still think there is a very large mid-market opportunity. That’s why we have both the major accounts team for lower mid-market and a national accounts team for upper mid-market to focus on those opportunities. We think there is the potential to increase unit volume over time and we have seen a significant increase in overall ASPs across the board in the business. In fact, our ASPs globally have gone up by 25% in the last year.Justin FurbyGot it. So, what is it, is it a 25%, is it a third, is it way less than that? Directionally, I’m really just curious what the mid-market is as a percentage?Adam MillerProbably around 20%.Justin FurbyGot it. Thank you very much, guys. Appreciate it.OperatorThis ends our Q&A session for today. I will turn it back over to Adam Miller for closing remarks.Adam MillerThank you all for your participation and we look forward to following up soon. Thank you.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s program. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect.")
# 2016 q1
csod.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorOur first question comes from Brent Thill with UBS. Your line is open."
            "Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLCThanks, good afternoon. 32% billings was the best in a year, yet you had one of the slower net new customer adds during the quarter. I guess you could explain that by the push to maybe larger enterprise contracts with fewer customers, but maybe if you could just drill into that dynamic and what you're seeing from that perspective? And I had a quick follow-up.Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerYes. So clearly we are doing more big deals, and we can talk about more later. I don't think you're going to see a dramatic uptick in the client count numbers until the second half of the year. As you remember, last year, we had some issues with our mid-market team. We have worked out solutions to those issues. And it takes a couple of quarters for them to take effect. So I suspect you'll see a much stronger customer count in the second half of this year and for the full year.Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLCOkay. And maybe a follow-up for Perry, too, just when you look at the head count adds, that your goal for this year will be dramatically lower than what you've added a year back. Can you just walk through productivity measures, kind of, what you're seeing? It seems like you feel like you have plenty of capacity to achieve what was still close to 30% growth. Can you just walk through the dynamic there?Perry Wallack - Co-Founder and Chief Financial OfficerYeah, sure. Let me pass that over to Adam and he'll give you a little bit of color on that, Brent.Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerYeah, Brent, specifically on the head count, it's a direct result of the operational excellence initiatives that we have in place. A lot of the head count reduction or incremental head count reduction, right, we're not actually reducing any existing heads, is based on the success we've had through automation projects and process improvement projects to lower the incremental G&A expense that's required.So we're becoming much more efficient in how we do a lot of back office processes and some of the support and service delivery that enables us to do the work with fewer incremental people.From a sales and marketing perspective, we have a lot of focus on efficiency, and that's happening through better spending and better allocation of head count, but we are still investing in sales and marketing, and so that's going to allow us to fuel growth over the long term.Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLCThanks, Adam.OperatorOur next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is open.Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLCYes. Thank you very much, and congratulations on the surprise early breakeven. So, Adam I wanted to ask you on the recruiting side of the ledger. That product seems to have very strong momentum for you. And I am curious if you're able to update us just on what percentage of your installed base has adopted that? I think it was 20% last fall or roughly 20%? And also, where do you think you are recruiting functionality stand today if you compare it to the Taleos and Kenexa of the world and I understand its intended to be a very different type of product, but if there is any way to compare and contrast (25:09)?Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerYeah. So, recruiting is now 20% penetrated and growing. It was just under 20% last year. We're now approaching best-in-class in recruiting. So we're obviously best of breed in talent management overall. But we are approaching best in class in recruiting. We just brought in the top ATS analyst in the space, who confirmed for us that we are now at parity with Taleo and Kenexa from a feature set perspective, which means we are now able to go to our install base and start doing take-away deals from those companies, which is very ripe right now. You have a lot of situations where it was a Taleo client at an SAP shop, and obviously with Oracle taking over Taleo and the company with SAPs or ERP systems, those things don't fit well together, creates opportunity for us, especially if they're already using Cornerstone as their talent management solution for everything else. And we have many instances of that.We also are seeing great opportunity to sell the full suite today. We now have over 40% of our clients with three or more products; over 70% with 2 or more products. So we're seeing the ability to cross-sell and up-sell the entire client base as well as sell more of our full platform upfront in new deals.Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLCThank you for that, Adam. So I wanted to ask as well, along the lines of what Brent had asked you, on the head count transfer this year, as you are focusing on the efficiencies that are driving the profitability, I'm wondering how big of a spread – and, actually, Perry, this might be more of a question for you.How big of a spread do you think you can maintain between the head count growth and the revenue growth, so, for example, it looks like this year, I think in round numbers, the top line is going to grow about 15 points faster than the head count of the company, and I guess, I'm wondering, is that long-term sustainable or is that – is that spread going to narrow perhaps in subsequent years?Perry Wallack - Co-Founder and Chief Financial OfficerNo, I think it's absolutely sustainable, if we are effective in how we're operating our business. We think there is lots of potential efficiencies that we have not yet captured in our business with regard to all of our back office operations, all of our technology operations.We're working on projects to make our developers more efficient, to make our quality assurance people more efficient. We are working on ways to make our support desk more efficient and drive excellence in all of our operations. All of those things enable you to do more with the same people, which allows us to keep growing the business without having linear growth in head count.Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLCOkay. Okay. So that would suggest your margins continue to expand pretty rapidly beyond this year, and I realize you're not guiding to that yet at this point, but I think that's what that suggests?The last one I wanted to ask you about, yeah, so, Adam, you're doing extremely well at the high end of the market and I think we had a sense of that but you rattled off a particularly large number of enterprise wins, and it would seem like that signifies a pretty big vote against the concept of the integrated suite. I mean, integrated in terms of core HR and talent management from the same vendor. And so they seem to be voting in favor of using, you know your separate systems for all of talent management.So I'm just wondering how you think those discussions are evolving, you know, why it's tilting that way and just also, is that dynamic any different or is it really the same thing in the mid-market?Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerWell, in the mid-market, you don't necessarily have the ERP systems in place. It depends on whether you're talking about the upper mid-market or the lower mid-market and where you draw the line between mid-market and enterprise. Generally, those companies are using extensions of their payroll providers and don't necessarily have full-blown global HRIS systems in place.In the large enterprise segment, all of our clients have an ERP system in place; some of them have many ERP systems in place. And we now have, as you know, thousands of examples of companies that have chosen to work with the best-of-breed talent solution even though their ERP provider offers some version of Talent Management. So we think this is now very well demonstrated in our market.We have proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that we can continue to sell independently of that functionality, and we are winning bigger and bigger deals and more of them. And I don't see that trend changing any time soon.Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLCThank you very much.OperatorOur next question...Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerJust to add on to that, part of the reason we've been effective is because of the business impact our solutions have. And the proof is the 95% retention rate that we still have today. The reason we win and keep our clients is because the solution works and it drives real business impacts, saving money, improving compliance, and driving efficiency in all the organizations that we work with.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham. Your line is open.Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLCHi, Adam and Perry, congrats on a very good quarter here. A couple quick ones. Can you talk about the revenue outperformance in the quarter. It was one of your bigger deeds in recent memory. Was it more timing or services related or was it subscription revenue related, relative to the big deals? I'm trying to understand what that balance is like maybe.Perry Wallack - Co-Founder and Chief Financial OfficerYeah. It's a combination of both. We actually had for the first time in a little while a quarter that wasn't so back end loaded, so you do get a little more software revenue within that quarter when you close the deals earlier in the quarter. And then in addition we did have some outperformance on our services revenue. So it was a combination of both factors.Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLCGreat. And then, Adam, can you talk a little bit about the bookings outperformance in the quarter. Obviously it was a great quarter, I think we all agree on that. But if you look at the Q1 execution or at least performance, how much would you put as a percentage on a better demand environment that you're seeing in 2016 relative to early 2015 versus just better internal execution?Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerI think there is a better demand environment, but in addition, within those deals, we're being more efficient at executing. So, what I mean by that is we're winning not just more deals, but bigger deals. And we've become very effective at holding price and growing the deal size because of the breadth of the product suite at this point. We now not only have multiple products; we essentially have multiple suites of products which give us the ability to drive more revenue in each individual deal.Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLCGreat. And one last quick one for me. We recently picked up that you let go of your mid-market sales leader. Assuming that's accurate, does that mean that the mid-market sales team is going through kind of a complete reorg, obviously given the challenges that segment had last year? Or is this just a small change and we should be able to see those improvements sooner rather than later?Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerSo, I believe we spoke about this on our last earnings call. We took out the leader of our national accounts team; mid-market to us is both our major accounts team and our national accounts team.In this case, we had difficulty in 2015, specifically in national accounts and so we took out a layer of management and have the regional managers reporting directly to the VP of mid-market sales. And that's proven to be effective. We've stabilized the teams. We had a lot of turnover last year. We have much more stability this year. We made some investment in the pipeline, demand generation for that segment, and that's been effective, and that speaks to my point earlier that you're going to see the client counts improve in the latter half of the year as these changes take effect on that team.Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLCGreat. That's all I have. Congrats on a great quarter. Thanks.Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerThank you.Perry Wallack - Co-Founder and Chief Financial OfficerThank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Your line is open.Patrick D. Walravens - JMP Securities LLCGreat. Thank you. Hey, Adam, can you give us an overview of where things stand in terms of the competition if there is any changes and if workday is starting to show-up in any way? Thanks a lot.Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerYeah, so we really don't see workday in a competitive position for new deals. What we're seeing is the same competition that we've always seen. So predominantly that's SAP, 80% of the time we see them in the finals anywhere in the world and our win rates continue to improve.We have now proven our ability to sell all the way up market. We now, as you know, have multiple examples of eight figure deals. In fact, we did another one in Q1 and that allows us to continue to sell the full spectrum, all the way up market and all the way down market and become increasingly competitive in the space, which allows us to hold price, it allows us to expand our product footprint earlier, and we continue to service our clients extremely well, which is why the retention is so strong.So, we're seeing the ability to really perform very well in all segments, and I think the competitive landscape is not going shift in part, because we're moving to a data driven world. So, as I talked about earlier analytics has been a big focus for us. We think our clients and quite frankly all cloud computing is moving to a more analytics-driven model. And the benefit there goes to companies that have the data. With now 25 million users in a 191 countries, we have the definition of what it means to have big data. And that gives us a real advantage not only relative to our current competitors but certainly relative to any newcomers into the space.Patrick D. Walravens - JMP Securities LLCGreat. Thanks a lot, Adam.Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerThank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open.Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.Hey. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats from me as well. That's a great first quarter. Two questions. First of all, Adam, could you talk a little bit about the changes because it looks like the execution has quite quickly improved in Q1? How much of that was kind of short-term measures that you did, and how much of that was items that we will continue to see as we go through the year?And then the second question is we didn't hear that much today about the midmarket product initiatives that was a big focus last year. Can you update also on that please? Thank you.Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerYeah, so I'll start with the last one. I think you mean the small business product initiative...Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.Right.Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive Officer... with Growth Edition. So Growth Edition...Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.Yeah.Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive Officer... was released at the very end of last year. We continue to work on the product. The focus there is for the second half of the year, which becomes peak selling season for that particular product line. And we will have had multiple releases by the time the second half of the year hits. And that's going to put us in a really good position for that segment. So we've geared up the sales teams for that particular product line – Growth Edition.With regard to our margins, we are just at the beginning of our operational excellence initiative. We've put a number of programs into place; some of them have already taken effect. You see that in the margin improvement that we've already been able to demonstrate, but we're just at the beginning. We think there's a lot of opportunity for continued margin expansion in all areas. We have initiatives that are targeted to each of the different segments of our business operationally, and some of it, again, is based on automation, some of it is based on process improvement, and some of it is based on rethinking how we do things.So one that I've spoken about before is the initiative we have around delivery, we call it project accelerate. And our focus there is decreasing the time it takes us to deliver a new client, essentially implement a new deal in half. So we want to take the average enterprise implementation from roughly four months to about two months. If we do that effectively, it will dramatically improve our margin as it relates to cost of sales. And there's opportunities like that throughout the entire business.Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.Thank you. Well done. Good luck.Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerThank you.Perry Wallack - Co-Founder and Chief Financial OfficerThank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Justin Furby with William Blair. Your line is open.Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLCHi, guys, congrats on the quarter. Apologies I jumped on late but just a couple questions, one in terms of pipeline, obviously big outperformance in Q1 Adam. I'm just curious what, as you look at pipeline entering Q2, how is it different from maybe a year ago in terms of the mix of enterprise across geographies, the types of deals that are multi element, any color there would be helpful around pipeline growth you're seeing there? And then I've got one follow-up. Thanks.Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerYeah. I mean, obviously I'm limited in what I can say about pipeline, but I will say in general, the demand environment is very good. We're seeing the ability to go further up market than we have in the past, and more large deals out there in the pipeline. We also are seeing general demand for full talent management, so we're doing more deals that involve the full platform. A lot of the product initiatives we have, whether we're talking about recruiting and onboarding or we're talking about the whole analytics suite or even edge are all based on market demand, based on being responsive to our existing clients and the prospects that are out there, and we think we have the right product strategy, which obviously is being proven out by our ability to continue to execute.Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLCGot it. That's helpful. And then I think probably 18 months or so ago; you said sort of a framework to think about the medium term growth as somewhere in the 30% to 35% range, inclusive of some new product initiatives. I'd just be curious for an update of how you're sort of over the last year-and-a-half how you're thinking about that, is that the right framework or what's changed since then? Thanks very much.Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerI mean, we said we could be relatively consistent with the growth we had last year and that obviously is demonstrated by our guidance that Perry gave. So, we think there's an opportunity to keep growing the business over the long-term. We don't see ourselves as being on the edge of a cliff. We certainly have not saturated the market. I've spoken before about the fact that even though our business is already 33% international, we believe that half of our business could be international.So, there's plenty of greenfield opportunity around the world. There's also clearly greenfield opportunity down market and another area that we haven't spoken about this quarter is just our ability to execute in the verticals. So, as we look at healthcare or life sciences or government or education, we're seeing the ability to tailor our products for specific industries and be extremely effective in those industries. All this...Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLCYeah. Thanks very much. Sorry, go ahead.Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerAll this is also benefited by the fact that we now have a series of significant partnerships with the major system integrators around the world. So whether our direct team is walking into those opportunities or they're being brought in by the system integrators, our ecosystem is now solid globally, and that's given us a really good position to continue to expand.Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLCGreat. Thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Brad Sills with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.Bradley Sills - Bank of America Merrill LynchHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just had one on the partner channel, both in the large enterprise and in the national major accounts. I wonder if you could comment a little bit about progress you've made over the last year or two with some of the global (43:13) that you've signed. Clearly you're getting results in large enterprise. And then also with ADP and IBM in the national major accounts, I know you mentioned last quarter that the goal there was to generate more leads through those channels. I wondered how that was going as well. Thanks a lot.Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerYeah. So with regards to major accounts, our pipeline from partners has always been strong, ADP in particular has been extremely effective there. We have since moved further up the mid-market chain and are being effective now with bringing in incremental pipeline and referrals for that team. That's part of what's driving the growth in pipeline for national accounts specifically. And with regard to large accounts, we're seeing a real ability to truly partner with these companies. So these are not reseller deals with the largest consulting firms out there. These are teaming deals.So we go in together, they walk us into accounts, if we're already in an account, they will help influence the deal in our favor, and it's allowed us to really cover the entire playing field in a way that we haven't been able to a couple years ago.It also allows us to level the playing field when we're in a particular deal. Obviously companies like SAP and Oracle have a lot of support from those vendors, and our partnerships have neutralized their advantage in that area, which allows us to compete on products and service, and there we always win.Bradley Sills - Bank of America Merrill LynchGreat. Thanks, Adam. And then one more if I may. You mentioned good progress with multiple products in accounts. I wonder if you could comment a little bit on the new signing. Are you seeing most of those larger new account signings come in with both learning and performance?If you could kind of compare that to, say, a year ago, or two years ago, what kind of trend you're seeing there and then succession in compensation, I assume those might come later, but just more on the kind of new signings, what are you seeing on initial sales? Thanks again.Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerYes. I'd say for quite a while now the majority of our deals have been learning and performance. What's happened more recently is that they're now learning performance and recruiting.And so these are becoming three pronged deals instead of two-pronged deals right out of the gate. That obviously creates a beachhead for us to move into Analytics, Edge, Link, and continue to broaden the suite with incremental products. So our footprint is growing in these accounts, which make them stickier and also creates incremental up-sell opportunities because obviously from analytics, the more a client is using the system, the more data they have.And therefore the more effective our analytic tools are. So you end up creating a virtuous cycle in the account. The more they use us, the more they use us, and that creates really good opportunity for us long-term. It's part of the reason that we've made some significant investment over the last 18 months in client sales. We think there's a real upside opportunity in growing our install base, and bigger initial footprint we have in an account, the more likely we are able to grow it over time.Bradley Sills - Bank of America Merrill LynchGreat. Thanks, Adam.Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerThank you.OperatorOur last question comes from Kyle Chen with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.Kyle Chen - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just really quickly, how large would you size the recruiting opportunity you referenced relative to Taleo, Kenexa, specifically, how many clients/seats do you think are available to replace and up-sell?Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerWell, we believe there's 400 million seats out there for everything we do including recruiting. We now have 25 million so we can grow the company many, many times over as we go after that opportunity. With regard to Taleo and Kenexa there are pretty good saturation of the enterprise market. I would say is probably 80% saturated by those two companies. Many of our existing clients have one of those two solutions in place. And in cases where they are either dissatisfied since the acquisitions of those companies or there's other issues that have risen, it creates opportunity for us to go in and be their replacement solution. In particular, where we've have been.Also there are many, many greenfield opportunities in recruiting, particularly in the middle market as well as in government and education. So we're seeing opportunities in all those segments to go in with recruiting. And in some of those, we actually lead with recruiting. For example, in education, we'll lead with recruiting in the deals.Kyle Chen - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)Got it. That's helpful. And just quickly, what was the impact of FX in terms of revenue and deferred this quarter? And also were there any changes to the average billing terms of the quarter that may have impacted the optics of the bookings growth?Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerYeah, sure, so the average billing term was roughly in line with historical periods. As far as revenue goes, FX had a drag of a little over $1 million dollars, and from a booking standpoint it had a drag of a little over $2 million.Kyle Chen - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)Got it. Thanks for the color.OperatorThis ends our Q&A session. I'll turn it back to Adam Miller, CEO, for Closing remarks.Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerThank you all for joining the call. As I think this quarter has demonstrated, there is truly global demand for unified talent management and we're at the forefront of that space. I also want to once again thank Perry for his incredible partnership over the last 16 years, and welcome Brian to the team. I think we are ready to move to the next phase of our business and become a mid cap company. I'm looking forward to seeing everybody next week at Convergence, our global client conference in Los Angeles on May 10. Thank you.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, thanks for participating in today's program. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect.")

            " question please.Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLCYes. Thank you very much. Congrats on the breakeven results and the solid constant-currency growth rates. So, Brian, I wanted to start by saying thank you for the additional disclosures. One question on the billings, was there any impact, either positive or negative, outside of FX-related factors? For example, did anything change materially in terms of invoicing duration or timing or ramp deals, late starts, anything like that?Brian L. Swartz - Chief Financial OfficerYes. No, first of all, thanks for the compliments. I appreciate that. In terms of general billing, nothing changed. It was all due to FX. There was slightly less upfront billings, which is pretty consistent with what we've seen in the last couple of quarters due to our success in the upper end of the market, but it was relatively minor and not significant. So it's principally virtually all FX related.Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLCOkay, great. And then also, forgive me, I don't know if this is going to be self-explanatory in the new website disclosures, which I have not seen quite yet. But can you tell us exactly what or roughly what percentage of your sales are denominated in pounds? And I was listening carefully. I believe it's essentially the vast majority of all of that international revenue. But for some reason, I had it in my mind that there might have been a couple points of euro or maybe Australian dollar or something like that. Is it possible to just walk us through those exposures?Brian L. Swartz - Chief Financial OfficerYes. Let me actually break it down for you. Just for clarity in my prepared remarks, Mark, virtually all of our international revenues flow through our UK entity, so all of them, regardless of what currency, the contracts, that the revenue contracts are denominated in, get converted to British pound. That's why it had such a big impact on our consolidated results.Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLCOkay.Brian L. Swartz - Chief Financial OfficerWhen you actually look at our UK entity, though, to answer your question, the percentage that is most of the revenue that comes into there is either denominated in euros or pounds. Pounds is about 10% of the total amount, so call it 9% or 10% of our overall sales are actually pound denominated. A large majority of the rest are euro denominated and then there are several other currencies that make it all up. So that's kind of the general breakdown.I would point you to in our 10-K we do have a segment disclosure in the 10-K, which also shows you roughly the same numbers, and they're based on where the customers and location is. That's how we break it down for purposes of the 10-K, so you can look at it there as well, but all the numbers are generally consistent with what I just quoted you.Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLCOkay, great. And so, Adam, I had two questions for you. The first one, we have heard some feedback that SuccessFactors might be downticking a little in terms of its competitive intensity or its presence in deals in recent months. I'm curious if you are observing that. And if so, do you think that that could open up any new opportunities in terms of large enterprise accounts?Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerYes. What specifically happened is the head of products for SuccessFactors went over to Google and that was their biggest competitive edge from a product standpoint. So I believe that going forward, their products will be a little weaker and we keep innovating, so that gives us the advantage from that standpoint. So we are still seeing them as the number one competitor around the world. And I don't expect that to change any time soon. But our ability to compete with them continues to improve.Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLCOkay. So, Adam, the last one I wanted to ask you. I would be curious to get your thought on the frenetic pace of the cloud M&A wave, because I think you've been pretty in tune with it in the past in prior cycles. And so it has not touched the HR realm yet in this wave in any material way. I think we're all wondering if at some point it will. But does the environment – does it feel rational or irrational? Do you think the activity has peaked or there's more to come? Is there any way you would guide us in terms of thinking how Cornerstone can continue to capitalize on all this activity?Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerNo, obviously, we don't comment about M&A on these calls. I would just say that obviously the floor has been set for valuations of cloud companies and the justification of the value of these assets, its scale has been demonstrated. Having said that, as you know, there has been tremendous M&A in our space in the past, so there are not very many assets that are independent at this point, and the consolidation has already occurred in this space.Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLCThank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Walravens from JMP Securities. Your question please.Patrick D. Walravens - JMP Securities LLCGreat. Thank you. I have two and I'll just lay them out at the beginning. So, Brian, for you now; now that you've had a little period under your belt, I'd love to hear what the positive surprises and the negative surprises have been? And then, Adam, following up on the M&A conversation but maybe sort of its impact on the fundamentals. How, if at all, do you think Microsoft acquisition of LinkedIn might affect the talent management market?Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerYes. I'll answer first. I think it was a very smart move from Microsoft. I think it helps them defend their position with Microsoft Office and with Outlook in particular as the hub of that positioning. So I think it was a very smart move for them. It has relatively little impact on us. As you know, there had been a lot of talk of LinkedIn in our space. That never actually occurred, and I think this will prevent that from occurring any time soon.So they now have their hands full working to bolster Microsoft Dynamics, working to bolster Microsoft Office 365 and what they're doing with Outlook. There's obviously a lot of potential synergies between those two groups. And most of it happens outside of our space. But as I have said before, LinkedIn and the success they've had does demonstrate the importance of talent management as a concept.Patrick D. Walravens - JMP Securities LLCOkay, cool. Thank you.Brian L. Swartz - Chief Financial OfficerAnd, Pat, it's Brian. Just to follow-up on the first question. It's been a whirlwind of a two months. I've obviously enjoyed getting to know the whole team here. What I would tell is I haven't had any of those moments where I found something out and I was like, oh, I can't believe I didn't find that out during the interview. There were none of those (34:45) moments. Everyone has been very transparent from day one. I think there's tremendous opportunity here. The more I get involved with the business and learn it, and it's only been a couple of months, the more I think there's great opportunity to help scale, drive profitability and top line growth. So it's been, like I said, a lot of fun and no negative surprises whatsoever and lots of opportunity in the future, soPatrick D. Walravens - JMP Securities LLCOkay, great. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Berg from Needham. Your question, please.Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLCHi, Adam and Brian. Congrats on a great quarter. Couple of quick ones here. First of all, Adam, can you comment about the demand environment a little bit. We've been picking up on our checks recently that RFP activity in the space seemed to tick up in Q2. And one of the questions we often get is how much longer can this double growth plus rate extend in this space here? And Q2 seems to indicate that there's no end in the sight. Just wanted to see if you guys are seeing the same thing.Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerYes. As I've said before, we believe there's 400 million potential seats are what we do. The whole industry has fewer than 100 million seats. We have close to 30% of that today. And there's a lot of potential growth around the world. We're seeing opportunities way up market at the top end of the largest enterprises in the world. We're seeing a really green field opportunity down market. As I mentioned earlier in my remarks, there are lots of opportunities outside of the U.S. In fact, even with Brexit, we saw strength in the UK market. So there's tremendous global opportunity. We are now selling around the world and we're seeing really good product/market fit almost everywhere. And our win rates globally continue to improve.Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLCGreat. And I guess the follow-up to that, Adam, is you were quite bullish in your prior remarks, specifically on Japan. I wanted to see if you can give us some additional color there, because I know a scenario where you've had some success, maybe had some starts and stops. But your color there or at least your initial comments seem to be the most bullish we've seen internationally in at least several quarters.Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerYes. So for anybody who has done business in Japan, they know it's a very traditional market that follows its own set of rules. And one of the key components of being successful in Japan is having reference accounts from very respected traditional Japanese firms. We now have those reference accounts. We're working with some of the biggest companies in Japan today. And the reason I'm so bullish after my trip is during my trip I was with them publicly talking to groups of potential prospects, which means not only do we have these companies as clients, but they are actively helping us build our business in the region. And these are companies like Hitachi and Nissan and others who are the biggest companies in Japan. And what they do matters to the rest of the market. So we are now well positioned to grow significantly in that market.It also, as I've said over the last couple of years, it takes us time to build our presence in markets, especially when we get into a brand new geography. And Japan is one of those markets that takes longer to gestate than others. But once you get it going, it's a very large opportunity. And in particular in Japan, it plays to our strengths. The Japanese market is comprised of many large enterprise companies. That's where we do arguably the best. And we are very well positioned now having reference accounts, a team there, track record and the ability to really grow with the product/market fit.Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLCGreat. That's all I have. Thanks for answering my questions.Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerThank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from UBS. Your question please.Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLCThanks. Adam, on the customer number, that was cut in half year-over-year. Can you just explain what's happening there on the customer number? And I would assume that's you're just getting larger transactions. And on the flipside, can you also talk about the rebuilding of the Mid-Market and what you're starting to see in that group in productivity as you head into the second half of the year?Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerYes. Thanks. That's a very fair question. And it's difficult for you guys to see what's really happening there, because of the fact that we're giving net client adds. So actually our gross client adds were in line with expectations and with our own internal plans. But the net number was down because of churn at the bottom end of the market. As we've gone further down market, as you all know, there is higher turnover in that segment of the market, you have companies that are more volatile, they are less viable as businesses. So if you have a company with 300 employees, there's a good chance that they're going to get acquired or merged or go out of business in some way. And you end up with more churn in that segment of the market.And having said that, our Mid-Market business does have opportunity to continue to improve, particularly in the second half of this year, and we are on track to do that. And we have reaffirmed our 95% dollar retention rate, which shows that we continue to have excellent levels of service across the board and we're keeping all of our major accounts. And that's what really helps us build the business over the long-term.So the reason the net number is low is because of more churn at the bottom end of the market. And, quite frankly, we are addressing that as well. Obviously we can't control if these companies have a corporate transition or bankruptcy, but to the extent we do have some control over it, we're going to do what we can to minimize churn in that segment as well.Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLCThanks, Adam.Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerThank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jesse Hulsing from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.Jesse Hulsing - Goldman Sachs & Co.Yes, thanks for taking my question. I have two. First to follow up on Brent's question about the Mid-Market business. I think on prior calls you've talked about it may be starting to come back and be a positive contributor in the second half, and I was wondering if that's what you're still expecting? And then second, I was hoping you could give us an update on the recruiting module and how you're doing with that part of your business, and I guess competitively versus Taleo what are you seeing?Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerGreat. So on Mid-Market, yes, we feel we're on track to have an uptick there in the second half of the year. The team has been extremely stable this year. That was the issue we had last year was instability on that team. And lower Mid-Market, our major accounts team has been a consistent performer, including the first half of the year, but we expect that to improve in the second half of the year as well.With regard to the second part of your question on recruiting, we are seeing really good traction in recruiting now. Recruiting was part of the reason we've had strong success in the first half of the year. We're seeing recruiting attached to a lot of our big deals now. So it's not just a Mid-Market play. This is a large enterprise play as well. In certain segments we're leading with recruiting, like in education. And with regards to Taleo, I believe we have reached the point of parity, and because of our faster release cycle, our faster rate of innovation versus Oracle, for example, we are able to now have the state-of-the-art enterprise solution for applicant tracking.So we believe we have the killer app now for recruiting out there for large enterprises. We continue to enhance that product, continue to extend our integrations. A lot of the work we're doing with Edge is specifically in the area of recruiting. And recruiting has become a big part of client sales as well. So we're starting to up-sell it to the installed base. In almost all of those cases, we are replacing either Taleo or Kenexa.Jesse Hulsing - Goldman Sachs & Co.Thanks, Adam. Very helpful.Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerThank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nemeroff from Credit Suisse. Your question please.Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Great quarter. And Brian, again, thanks for those additional resources. Those are very helpful. Adam, I'm just trying to square your comments on the customer churn towards the low-end of the market with the re-release of that Mid-Market product over the last couple of quarters. Is that as a result? I mean, is this planned? I'm just trying to square the two comments.Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerNo. So thanks for bringing that up, because it gives me a chance to clarify. SMB is not included in our client accounts. We've never included what we consider small business, which is companies with fewer than 250 employees, in our client count. So where the churn is happening is what we call major accounts, companies with between 250 employees and 1,000 employees. And as you can imagine, the ones going out of business or getting acquired away, are the ones at the lower end of that segment. So they are closer to 250 employees than they are to a 1,000 employees. And that is being offset obviously by the strength we have at the higher end of the market, and the 95% retention rate we've experienced since inception.Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)That's great. Thanks, Adam. And then...Brian L. Swartz - Chief Financial OfficerHey, Mike, I'm sorry.Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)Go ahead, Brian.Brian L. Swartz - Chief Financial OfficerMike it's Brian. Just one more point of clarity. I think the product you're referring to the new release was the growth addition product, which is the SMB product, which was released in November of 2015. So that product is not in the client accounts that Adam was referring to. I just wanted to clarify that product release late last winter or I guess early in the winter, in the November timeframe, was related to that SMB market.Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)So that's helpful, Brian. Thanks. And then as it relates to Brexit and the tone of business in Europe, aside from the FX track that we saw, and thanks for helping us work through that very explicitly. Are you seeing any hesitation or drop in demand from that region? We haven't heard it too much out of some of the companies that have already reported, but every once in a while we're hearing it?Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerWe've seen no impact at all. In fact, I was particularly concerned, because we had a lot of business closing at the very end of the quarter from the UK and all of that business closed. So there was no direct operational impact from Brexit, obviously a huge FX impact, but not an operational impact. The one area that Brexit does bring up for prospects and for the sales process, is around data security and data privacy, because of our data center being in London. So, our primary European data center is in the UK. And there are some potential challenges to keeping it in the UK over the long term. But it depends on how the UK and the rest of the EU work out their data privacy concerns.Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)That's helpful Adam. And then lastly for Brian, I think Adam you had mentioned you've identified some further areas where you can reduce the cost going forward to expand the margins and get the free cash flow up. Brian, is it on the COGS side or the expense side, where you've identified some of those easy or low-hanging fruit on those?Brian L. Swartz - Chief Financial OfficerYeah, I think it's more on the expense side. I mean just to give you an example. We're going to be investing kind of more directly in sourcing and procurement. I think there's a real opportunity with the services we buy from third parties to really have an impact on the rates we're paying, as an example. So, it's spread amongst all the operating expenses and there's some in COGS as well.Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions.Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerIn particular COGS will improve as what I call program accelerate takes hold. This is a big project that takes a long time. And we're not going to see the impact this year. That's going to start to have an impact in 2017. And will be I believe meaningfully impacting our cost of sales and improving our gross margin accordingly.Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)That's great. Thanks for taking my questions.Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerThank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Furby from William Blair & Company. Your question, please.Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLCThanks, guys. Congrats. I'll try to put a lot of things in one question. I want to ask on billings, I guess you are guiding for Q3 to be quite a bit lower as a percentage of the full year, as it was last year. And I'm not saying the Street is right on the full year. But if they are and you take the 23% of that Brian, it says something like 8% growth in Q3 for billings, and I know you have some FX impact, but it shouldn't be nearly as big as it was in Q2 in terms of the deferred revaluation, so I'm just struggling as to the pipeline commentary and what we're hearing around that versus the guidance and why billings would be anywhere near that level?And then I guess on cash flow, just help me understand the 20% cut on the guidance. I guess I thought the pound, it's only 10% of your business. So wouldn't that be the real economic exposure there? And so any help on that would be appreciated. Thanks.Brian L. Swartz - Chief Financial OfficerYeah, no, absolutely, Justin. Let me see if I can help you on both of those. First of all, on the billings guidance for Q3 in my commentary, our full-year plan is right in line with what we expected. It's really a timing issue between Q3, Q4. So obviously the numbers in the second half are impacted by FX and then just given what we're seeing in our pipeline, it's just a timing issue of when we expect things to close between Q3 and Q4. So the pipeline remains strong and we are right on track. I just wanted to give you some commentary to make sure everyone understands what we're headed for at least Q3 and Q4 based on what we know today.On your second question, with respect to cash flow, it's really also a timing impact, right. It's a question of when we collect cash versus when we recognize things at our P&L. So because there's only a half a year left and obviously Brexit happened at the end of June, we feel basically the 100% impact from the cash, but the P&L impact, so to speak, both on the OpEx, obviously more on the revenue, is spread out over time. So it's really just a function. And to give you an example, with December 31 and we were expecting to collect $10 million and the currencies moved by 10%, we would collect $9 million, you wouldn't feel any of that in your P&L until the future years. But you would feel 100% of it on the cash flow. So that's the change for the numbers.The other thing I wanted to point out, just to help everyone with expectations setting for the second as well. We obviously had a great first half of the year, break-even results. We expect to be profitable for the full year, as we guided to. We do expect our profit to come in Q4 versus Q3, so just from a timing perspective as it helps you build your models and think through Q3 and Q4. Q3 should be hopefully be break-even or positive. But it could be a negative with a loss in Q4 generating the profit for the year. So I wanted to give that commentary as well since you asked the question.Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLCOkay. Thank you.Brian L. Swartz - Chief Financial OfficerWelcome.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle from Pacific Crest Securities. Your question please.Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest SecuritiesThanks so much. Adam, you highlighted the nice profits (51:12) you're looking at in Asia-Pac. I was wondering if you could give us any update on Latin America. I know that had turned around in the last couple of quarters. And then also in the public sector, which I know has been sort of hit-or-miss over the last couple of quarters.Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerYeah. So Latin America, we are doing extremely well in Mexico. Our focus has been specifically on Mexico and Brazil. Brazil is a little bit like Japan in that, it's just a longer time to gestate. So Mexico had a shorter gestation cycle. We're doing quite well. We've ramped up our investment there and we're seeing the fruits of that investment. Brazil is taking a little bit longer.In public sector, we've done quite well in education this year, particularly in K-12 and in the non-profit space, we are having mixed results in government, and I think because this year has been a much more tumultuous election cycle, we're seeing less activity than we originally expected in federal, as a direct result. And I don't know that that's going to change this year, until the election happens.Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest SecuritiesGreat. That's helpful. And just a quick one for Brian. So far through the first half of the year, CapEx is running pretty well below where it was last year. I'm wondering if we should be modeling that same kind of run rate for the back half or do you see some kind of catch-up happening in the back half?Brian L. Swartz - Chief Financial OfficerYeah. We think it'll be less in Q3 and more in Q4. But it should be below last year's number, and not at the same level. But it should come – whatever amount comes, will come in the Q4 timeframe.Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest SecuritiesOkay. Great. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question, please.Brad Sills - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.Hey, guys. Congratulations on a nice quarter. Adam, it sounds like you're more positive on kind of opportunities for the strategic accounts business, I guess the very large deals in some of your comments. Can you talk a little bit about what you saw this quarter in that segment of the market both on signings and then on pipeline as well, please?Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerYeah. So the pipeline has been pretty stable throughout the year. It continues to grow as we build out that team around the world. And the deals are long sales cycles. So we are well on our way in a number of large opportunities. We expect those to happen more towards the end of the year. It's just typically when these largest deals close and that's been true really our entire history. I don't think it'll be any different this year.Brad Sills - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.Got it. Great. Thanks, Adam. And then just one on Workday, we're hearing that they've been in the market now for some time and they've kind of been having less impact than maybe thought initially. Can you comment a little bit on what you're seeing with Workday and some of the sales cycles? Thank you.Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerNot less than I thought. So, they've had the same impact I've expected the whole time and I've been talking about for a while.Enterprise learning is a very complicated area that requires an incredible amount of functionality to meet the needs of global companies. And we are uniquely positioned to support the largest companies in the world, with their global training and development requirements. And I think that remains true and that's the reason we haven't seen a lot of new entrants into the space. We still spend a majority of our R&D on learning. And all the various products we have in the learning and development area. And that keeps our competitive edge in that space.Brad Sills - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.Great. Thanks, Adam.Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerThank you.OperatorThank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your question please.Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.Thanks for taking my question. And congrats as well from me. Brian, the legal structure seems kind of slightly on the odd ends, I mean we don't have it for any other companies. Now that you're in there and reviewing, is there a sense to kind of maybe have a look at that, while you're going through that?Brian L. Swartz - Chief Financial OfficerYeah. As you can imagine, Raimo, we've already been doing that. We're working on it for well over a month now. It's hard for me to speculate about exactly what we might do or what might change. But we're looking to optimize the structure. I mean the bottom line is we do not want to have volatility in our results, because there's huge movements in any one or baskets of currencies. And so there are lot of different alternatives that we're looking at and as we have more clarity as to exactly what we're going to do, I'll certainly talk to you more about that.Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.Perfect. Thank you.OperatorThank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'd like to hand the program back to Adam Miller, CEO, for closing remarks.Adam Miller - Founder, President & Chief Executive OfficerThank you all for joining the call. And we hope to catch up with you soon at one of the many investor conferences coming up. Thank you.OperatorThank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.")
# 2016 q3
csod.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you. Our first question comes from Scott Berg from Needham. Your"
            " line is open.Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLCHi, Adam and Brian. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a couple here for you. First off, Brian, going back to your last comments there around payment term changes in the third quarter. Can you help us quantify kind of what that looked like either on a magnitude basis or how it impacted billings in the quarter?Brian L. Swartz - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Yeah, Scott. Nice to hear from you. Thanks for the question. First of all, we're going to try to limit everyone's questions to one question, so please try to do that. With respect to the extended payment terms, it had a mild impact on some deals that we did in late Q3, which, as I mentioned in the script, will push the timing of those cash collections into 2017. With respect to upfront billings rate, it was pretty consist with what we saw in the first half of this year, down slightly year-over-year, but pretty consistent with what we saw in the first half of this year.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill from UBS. Your line is open.Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLCThanks. Adam, just on the mid-market, you've been working on this for quite some time. What is, in your opinion, not firing at the level that you'd like there and I'm curious how long you think it's going to take to pull this back into where you'd like to see it? Is this a multi-quarter initiative, is this one quarter out?And Brian, if you can remind us the percent of the revenue that's derived from this particular sector; I think the last account we had was close to 35% to 40% of revenue, is that kind of a fair change for the mid-market business as a percent of revenue?Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Yes. So, this is something that is already underway. It will happen very quickly. And we think it boils down to the fact that when we split up these teams, we put the reps in a position where either they were doing a lot of small deals with no chance at a home run, or they were working on very large deals with no chance of momentum, no singles or doubles for them.And so, we think by putting the territories back together, putting the teams back together and streamlining that organization, it allows us to have, number one, much better efficiency, on the productivity side and the cost side, and number two, much better productivity for the reps. So the reps have a greater ability to consistently perform and to hedge their portfolio, mixing both small and large deals in their pipelines. And that is what we saw back in 2012 and 2013 when the teams were structured that way.Brian L. Swartz - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.And Brent, its Brian, just to follow up on the second part. We have not broken out – we have never broken out actually the actual segmentation of our clients. As you know, we are primarily an enterprise upper market business. But we haven't provided the exact breakdown of what percentage of revenue is in mid-market.Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLCThanks.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is open.Unknown SpeakerHi, Adam. Thanks for taking my question. I'm sitting in for Mark here, Benjamin. We actually heard from a few of your partners that there has been a surge of deals in the learning and the recruiting space of late. In learning, obviously, we know that you're the leader, but in recruiting, seems like it's a very crowded space with a lot of smaller players. How do you view that market from relative to your opportunities and have you seen any deals where you have actually led with recruiting as of now? Any color would be great. Thanks.Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Yeah. So, as you know, if you've been covering the ATS market for a while, Taleo and Kenexa dominate the enterprise segment. Between them, they have probably 80% plus market share in that segment, at least at their peak. And because they were both acquired a couple of years ago, many of those deals are back out for renewal. And that's created a pretty large opportunity in the enterprise segment for recruiting. So, our focus has been upper market in recruiting.Having said that, there are many smaller players now in the recruiting space with the advent of social recruiting, machine learning-based recruiting, chat box and the like, all of which have certain strong functional feature sets in various specific areas. But those are narrow solutions, they're not enterprise class. And we do not see them in these larger competitions.Now, what's changed is that, historically, we've sold recruiting as part of our overall talent platform. And more recently, particularly in certain segments, we have been able to lead with recruiting or do recruiting-only deals, so stand-alone ATS replacement deals in the enterprise. And today, recruiting represents about 20% of our client base from a perpetration perspective. That's up significantly from a couple of years ago. And we continue to see good momentum in the recruiting area. So, we continue to invest in that product set.Unknown SpeakerThank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Mike, I don't know if you're on mute. We can't hear you.Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)Can you hear me?Brian L. Swartz - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Yes.Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Yeah.Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)Okay. Thanks. Yeah. So, Brian, I'm curious. I know you haven't guided for 2017 – operational excellence initiatives that you talked about, I'm curious, what kind of expectations you would like investors to have in terms of cash flow or free cash flow?Brian L. Swartz - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Yeah. And I think, Michael, the way we're viewing it right now, we laid out, as you know, about six months ago, some long-term margins targets for 2018. We are still focused on hitting those. We're actually focused on exceeding them. From the standpoint of where exactly we think 2017 will land at this point, just given some of the changes and, quite frankly, Q4 is generally a time when most companies do budget.It's obviously our biggest quarter is seasonally in the sector, and then all the other decisions we're doing around the focus around growth and profitability, we're just not prepared to comment today on what to expect in 2017. But we are standing by the 2018 long-term targets. And our profitable is getting much stronger, so our free cash flow should grow nicely over time as well.Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)Okay. And then – I'm sorry. I joined the call a little bit late, but when I looked at the numbers, the sales and marketing expense this quarter was down substantially, but the guidance implied that there's a pretty significant ramp back up. Could you explain that? I'm sorry if I missed that earlier.Brian L. Swartz - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Yeah. Well, we didn't guide exactly to the sales and marketing for Q4. So, in general, because of some of the pressure from currency, we obviously lowered our revenue by about $3 million. The profit is up $2 million. We weren't explicit on where that would come out quarter to quarter. But we do expect that to have a pretty substantial savings on just operating expenses in general.Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.OperatorOur next question comes from Jesse Hulsing with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.Jesse Hulsing - Goldman Sachs & Co.Yeah. Thank you. Adam, you mentioned some challenges in Europe that were Brexit related and it sounded like having data centers in the UK was one of the issues. And I'm wondering what steps you're taking to help ease those concerns of your European customers. And I guess, looking at how Q4 has started in Europe, are you starting to see improvement in the close rate there? Thank youAdam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Yeah. So, specifically around data privacy and data security, we have extensive experience in this area. We have a chief data privacy officer, a chief information security officer. We have teams dedicated not only to technology operations, but also specifically to data security and privacy.And the issue has to do with just the unknown in the European Union. And as you saw this morning, even Brexit itself is unclear. So, there's much confusion, and I would describe it simply to say that it's elongated sales cycles. So we are able to overcome it. We do have plans if necessary to open up the data center in Continental Europe to alleviate any concerns from the EU. But, right now, nothing has been decided as far as both Brexit and the interrelationship between the EU and the UK post Brexit if it occurs.As a result, we have not made any decision yet on what to do there. And the clients accept that and understand it, it just takes longer to explain. And so something that was very simple and a non-issue pre-Brexit has become a major point of discussion post-Brexit, elongating sales cycles. And we've seen that very clearly both in the Continental European prospect deals and amongst our UK opportunities.So, we're seeing the impact of Brexit on both sides of the EU at this point. And I do believe it is a short-term phenomenon. And these deals are not being closed. It's not that we're losing the deals, they're just getting delayed. And so I think it will come back and the long-term will be fine.Jesse Hulsing - Goldman Sachs & Co.Got it. And then just a quick follow-up for Brian along the same thread. Is there – have you guys tried to quantify what the impact was from that? Because it sounds like – that's a big chunk of business for you. It sounds like it could've been many deals. I'm wondering if it was single-digits millions of dollars type of impact or bigger or lesser or any help around that would be helpful. Thank you.Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Let me answer that. As you know, Europe represents about 30% of our business, and I have felt strongly that our global diversification and percent of international business, about a third of our business today is outside the U.S., are extremely strong assets of the business, particularly over the long term. I would say relative to any other public SaaS company, we have been very strongly diversified internationally.But, of course, in the near term, it's become a liability with Brexit. So that's impacted both our ability to sell in that EU part of the market and it's impacted overall currency rate, so that impacts both revenue and deferred revenue as well as cash flow. And it's worth mentioning that within Europe, which is 30% of our revenue, the UK has been the strongest market historically. So, it's a more exaggerated impact than it should otherwise have in the case of Cornerstone relative to other companies that are out there.Jesse Hulsing - Goldman Sachs & Co.Thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Samad Samana with Stephens. Your line is open.Samad Samana - Stephens, Inc.Thanks for taking my question. I kind of wanted to follow up a little bit on that. Can you – it seems like the billings implied guidance for next quarter is slightly down actually year-over-year. Can you give us how much of that impact is due to Brexit versus national accounts versus FX, so we can have an idea of the magnitude of each issue impacting billings? And then just generally, what does the 4Q large deal pipeline look like?Brian L. Swartz - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Yeah. So, a couple of things; in terms of breaking them down into different components, Samad, it's hard to do. We haven't done that. But here's what I can do to help you. The implied guidance does the math if you do the math on my comments – my prepared remarks. It does indicate that on a reported basis we're down slightly, flat to slightly down. But, remember, there's a big currency impact there. And on a constant currency basis, the difference between the reported and the constant currency growth year-over-year in Q4 will actually be bigger than it was in Q3 based on the guidance, because since September 30, the pound has weakened more.Now, that changed this morning, obviously, but who knows where the quarter will end. So, keep that in mind as the difference between reported and constant currency growth when you're comparing year-over-year growth Q3 to Q4. With respect to breaking it down specifically between the components, we haven't done that, but you can certainly make some conclusions or draw some conclusions on your own. But it will at least help you – tell you where we expect the overall growth to be in Q4.Samad Samana - Stephens, Inc.And then just as a quick follow-up if I could, the users per client continues to grow nicely, but the net adds is tracking lower than levels seen last year. Could you just help us maybe understand is it just larger clients where you're narrowing your focus or is there some churn at smaller clients? Just help us to understand that number.Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.So, our client adds have grown sequentially and part of this, again, is the impact of the mid-market issues we've had as most of the client adds we've had historically when those numbers were quite high, it was lower mid-market client adds. And so, as we restructure that group, I think those numbers will come back up. But, generally, our retention has remained very strong and our growth up-market has remained quite strong. So, I wouldn't overly look at the unit metric, but it has improved sequentially quarter-over-quarter.Samad Samana - Stephens, Inc.Great. Thanks for taking my questions.Brian L. Swartz - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Can I make one comment? Just to elaborate that to help you, Samad, and everyone else. I think just to help break down the different components, I did mention in the call that with respect to billings in Q4 that the FX impact was $6 million, and then with the balance to the other major ones that we talked about, obviously, the major components just being kind of the UK slowdown or elongated sales cycle and then the impact of big markets. They're about 50/50 in terms of balance between the two if you're looking to where things were previously and where they will settle for Q4 now.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.Alex J. Zukin - Piper Jaffray & Co.Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, Brian, maybe on the current quarter, if I look at the deferred revenue delta between kind of what you reported and the estimate about $8 million, how does that break down in terms of the mid-market team versus the international component? And in your mind, does that – I know you don't want to comment on how that changes the long-term growth rate, but given those two uncertainties and kind of given where growth has been, is there at least any kind of color you guys can provide on a high level about the intermediate growth pace of the company now?Brian L. Swartz - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.So, I'm sorry. I just want to make sure I understand the beginning part of your question. You mentioned something – are you talking about the current quarter Q3, are you talking about Q4, and then you mentioned...Alex J. Zukin - Piper Jaffray & Co.Yeah, I'm talking about Q3. The deferred revenue in Q3, the breakdown of that kind of the mid-market team effect versus the international effect.Brian L. Swartz - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Well, for Q3, the reported billings – total billings was about $107 million. I'm sorry – $107 million, which is impacted by currency. So, in fact, I think I made a comment that if you look at the cash flow method, its closer to $110 million, which is pretty much in line with kind of what I talked about on the last call. So I'm not sure what you mean by the breakdown between the mid-market with respect to Q3.Alex J. Zukin - Piper Jaffray & Co.Yeah, I guess, I still don't understand. I still don't see how that $8 million delta, from a deferred revenue perspective, where you came in versus where you had been expecting is kind of all currency? I guess maybe how much of the delta above and beyond FX was due to the deals getting delayed or going through? We can take it offline.Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Yeah, if you look at the billings, the $107 million on a constant currency basis would've been $110 million, $111 million is where the Street was. So we are basically exactly in line with billings and, obviously, beat with both revenue and earnings. So, these impacts are really future impacts...Brian L. Swartz - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Right.Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc....which is what we've been talking about.Alex J. Zukin - Piper Jaffray & Co.Okay. Understood.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Brad Sills with Bank of America. Your line is open.Brad Sills - Bank of America Merrill LynchHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Wonder if you could comment a little bit on how the enterprise versus strategic accounts group performed this quarter and then any commentary on how that's tracking for Q4.Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Yeah. So, specifically, the enterprise team has been our backbone from the beginning, and continues to be a very strong performer, obviously, through this year and also all of last year. We also are seeing great results from our client sales organization. The issue for us has specifically been mid-market as well as the impact of Brexit.So, strategic account, specifically, has had a very strong first half of the year and, probably, will end the year quite well. But we did have a big opportunity that is coming later in the year than might otherwise have occurred. I think we thought it could pull into Q3, but will end up most likely being in Q4.Brad Sills - Bank of America Merrill LynchGreat. Thank you.Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.And we continue to do a number of eight-figure deals, and I think we'll have more in the pipeline in the future.Brad Sills - Bank of America Merrill LynchExcellent. Thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open.Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.Thanks for taking my question and well done on the performance on the profitability side and the cash flow side. Brian, you talked about the changes you wanted to do in the organization around that. Can you just elaborate a little bit? Is that kind of – do you have to think about dynamic budgeting, what other guys are doing to kind of run the business more dynamic in terms of where the investments are going in and where you're not going to invest? Thank you.Brian L. Swartz - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Yeah. It's a good question. The way we think about is we want a healthy balance between revenue and profitability fundamentally. And I'll give you a perfect example of what I mean by that. It relates to the changes in our cash flow guidance for this year. So my philosophy on cash flow is pretty simple. We should pay our vendors when we say we're going to pay our vendors and we should expect that our clients are going to pay us when they say they're going to pay us.So, as a result of that, we're not going to do things at year-end that just don't create long-term value for the business, right? And you can see historically, there have been obviously a lot of movements in our working capital in Q4 and, I think, taking some of that out of the business and focusing on the long term is what creates value over time, right? It's not short-term changes to cash flow.So that's an example of at least the way we think about it. I think, looking throughout the rest of the organization around optimizing efficiency, we don't want to invest just for growth just for growth sake; we want to invest in profitable growth. We want to do it in a consistent way. As we see market opportunity, we'll put capital to work to capture that market opportunity, but not overload the market so that we can't capture the market opportunity in a consistent way. So that's how we think about it. That's how we're going to be focused on building the plans for 2017 and beyond.Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.Okay. Perfect. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our last question comes from Justin Furby with William Blair. Your line is open.Vinay Mohan - William Blair & Co. LLCHey. This is actually Vinay in for Justin. I got a question on the mid-market and then a quick follow-up. Any commentary on the partnership with ADP and sort of with what happened in the mid market, how that played out, whether it contributed, benefited at all? And then I had a quick follow-up on percentage of new business that you're selling back into the base and any additional color there? Thanks.Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Actually, going back to a single mid-market team helped the relationship with ADP because we had a support team, created a little bit of confusion between where referred deals would flow. I would say the partnership probably worked more effectively when we had a single team. And I think we'll go back to that.So, ADP, amongst other partners, will help us continue to build our pipelines, and our mid-market pipelines are significantly stronger than they were in the past. So, we think going forward, the combination of a single team and the stronger pipelines will lead to good results.Vinay Mohan - William Blair & Co. LLCAnd then a quick follow-up on the percentage of new business that you saw selling back into the base and sort of any commentary on what kind of module you're adding back both for enterprise and, I guess, mid-market at well? Thanks.Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Yeah. So, client sales have been very effective over the last year since we've moved to immediate transference of account to the client sales organization upon the closing of the deal. That's been a very effective approach for us. That team has done quite well all throughout the year. And we expect to continue to grow.It's one of the reasons we've continued to invest in the product area. And we have seen very good adoption of recruiting, along with not just the ATS product, but the entire suite, including onboarding. And we now are seeing our deals getting expanded into full human capital management deals with the addition of Link, which we launched back in May.The adoption's been quite good of Link, combined with analytics and our talent suite really provides the full human capital management solution to our clients. That does elongate the sales cycle, so it does have some impact on the timing of deals. But it also increases the size of those deals, and so that patience is warranted to get those larger opportunities. They're also higher margin deals because same amount of effort goes into closing that deal, but it ends up with a higher ASP. So we are looking forward to the client sales team continuing to perform and continuing to execute across our entire product platform.Vinay Mohan - William Blair & Co. LLCAwesome. Thanks.OperatorThis ends our Q&A session. I'll turn it back to Adam Miller, Chief Executive Officer, for closing remarks.Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Thank you all for joining the call today and we look forward to seeing you out at conferences and in the field soon. Thank you.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, thanks for participating in today's program. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect.")
# 2016 q4
csod.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorCertainly. Our first question comes from the line of Jesse Hulsing from"
            " Goldman Sachs. Your question please.Jesse Hulsing - Goldman Sachs & Co.Yeah. Thank you for taking my question. Adam, billings came in above expectations. First, can you give us a sense of if there were deals that slipped out of the third quarter and helped growth in the fourth quarter? And I guess, second, on a go forward basis, do you feel some of the disruption that you had last quarter around Brexit and around the mid-market sales reorg are firmly behind you?Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Sure. So, with regard to slippages, I would say every quarter we have certain deals that slip. But there was nothing unusual about what happened in the third quarter going into the fourth quarter, just business as usual. We also had, I think, started to see a better consistency out of EMEA. And we expect to see decent recovery out of EMEA this year, especially with the announcement of both data centers. Mid-market, as we've said before, we've just lowered our expectations. So, we do expect some modest growth, but more importantly our expectations which translates to our guidance assumes lower growth for that business overall in mid-market.Jesse Hulsing - Goldman Sachs & Co.Great. Thank you, Adam.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Berg from Needham. Your question please. You may have your phone on mute.Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLCMy apologies there. Adam and Brian, congrats on a good quarter. I guess my question here would be, Adam, on the big deal environment. If I guess, if we look back in 2015 you guys made some noise in the big deal environment which is characterized as kind of eight figure or greater deals on a total contract value. Just wanted to see if you can comment on what you're seeing there both in the quarter and as you enter 2015 (sic) [2017]. Is this still a segment that remains pretty flush for you guys or has there been any changes?Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Yeah. So, in the fourth quarter we did not have any eight figure deals, but it's worth mentioning that we had our second largest quarter ever in terms of the number of seven figure deals. So we were doing a lot of big deals not just the enormous ones.Having said that, we still think there's a very big opportunity in strategic accounts, and there are many big logos still out there for the taking. And we continued to be bullish on that team and the pipeline looks good for this year.Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLCGreat. And if can slide one follow-up in, Brian, on the G&A line, your G&A has grown throughout the year. And you kind of talked to a little bit about what some of those additional inputs are. Is there any reason to think that we don't get some leverage from that next year, because it grew I think 45% 46% in the fourth quarter year-over-year, which was a pretty large growth number given the revenue growth side?Brian L. Swartz - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.No, there's no reason why you shouldn't see that, Scott. We do expect to get leverage in that line item in both 2017 and beyond.Scott Berg - Needham & Co. LLCGot it. That's all I have. Thanks for taking my questions.Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Thank you.OperatorOur next comes from the line of Brad Sills from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.Brad Sills - Bank of America Merrill LynchHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Adam, one for you please on core HR link. You sound pretty bullish on that for this year. Can you describe a little bit please what you saw in 2017 (sic) [2016] in terms of early adoption, departmental replacements perhaps in some of the larger accounts? Where are you seeing displacement? Who you may be displacing there? And what's changed about 2018 (sic) [2017]? Is it just kind of more maturity, better developed pipeline heading into 2018 (sic) [2017] for core HR?Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Yes. I'll answer that based on 2016 and 2017 instead of 2017 and 2018.Brad Sills - Bank of America Merrill LynchYeah. I'm sorry. Sorry, that's what I mean, my bad.Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.But within Cornerstone HR specifically, in 2016, we've had dozens of wins around Cornerstone HR. We're seeing a pretty robust pipeline. But it's important to mention that our view of Cornerstone HR is very specific. We don't see us going head-to-head with the traditional core HR players for centralized global replacements.We really view this as an alternative to either doing nothing or ripping and replacing your legacy core HR system with a single global system. And so the opportunities we've seen most notably are around what we call the hub model, where Cornerstone HR is used on top of typically multiple existing core HR and payroll systems as a single point of information and reporting. And that's been a very effective approach. That's allowed us to mature the product, and continue to serve our client base.Our view is the best situations are when an account really wants to lead with talent management, but has some HR administrative needs, we can meet those requirements. Let them keep, in many cases, keep their existing core HR infrastructure, their existing integrations and yet get the benefit of modern architecture, a modern user interface, real-time reporting data visualization, predictive analytics, and the like with the full Cornerstone HCM solution.Brad Sills - Bank of America Merrill LynchGreat. Thanks. Then one more, if I may, please on sales productivity. Given your target for low mid-teens growth for billings, call it mid high for constant currency. At that level of growth, do you feel like there's a need for more hiring, you feel like you can – or is there more productivity you can get out of your existing folks that you have in sales? Thank you.Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.So we think there's opportunity for increased productivity. We've rebalanced our head count. So we took head count from low-performing teams and moved them to high-performing teams. This simultaneously improved sales efficiency and produces better growth.Brian L. Swartz - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.The one thing I would add is that we do have more people today than we had a year ago. And so we have more kind of quota carrying reps, quota capacity out there today than we did a year ago. So you've seen substantial improvements on the financial side, but it's not at the simple result of just cutting a lot of people out in the field. In fact, it's just the opposite. Like I said, we have more than we did a year ago.Brad Sills - Bank of America Merrill LynchGreat. Thanks, guys.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Piper Jaffray. Your question please.Alex J. Zukin - Piper Jaffray & Co.Hey guys, congrats on a good quarter. Maybe first one, has anything changed in the way that you're managing deals with respect to profitability or discounting or levels that you're willing to go to kind of get deals?Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Well, I would say specifically in the mid-market going into 2017, we recognized the need because of a combination of low cost competition and start-up competition combined with, in some cases, the larger players giving away some of the solution. There has been pricing pressure specifically in the mid-market and so we have updated going into 2017, our pricing and packaging for the mid-market. And we think it'll be very effective given the dynamics of the market now.Alex J. Zukin - Piper Jaffray & Co.Got it. And then maybe Brian one for you, last quarter you mentioned you saw, I think, some increased payment terms given to clients at the end of the quarter, which resulted in some payment collections being pushed into 2017. How should we think about the timing and the magnitude of that impact?Brian L. Swartz - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Yeah. We did not – I mean, those – we will collect those that happened at the end of the third quarter, obviously then we'll collect within terms or normal DSOs in terms of normal collections. We did not see that continue or persist throughout Q4. In fact, just the opposite, it kind of returned to historical levels in terms of level of payment terms we give clients.Alex J. Zukin - Piper Jaffray & Co.Got it. Thanks, guys.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nemeroff from Credit Suisse. Your question please.Michael Nemeroff - Credit SuisseHey guys, thanks for taking my questions and nice billings this quarter. Adam, what steps, if any, other than improving the company's performance have you undertaken to enhance shareholder value and can we get your most recent thinking on keeping Cornerstone an independent vendor versus looking at alternative options? And then also in your prepared remarks, you mentioned – did you have any measurable data regarding the uptick in opportunities when you released the recruiting product to draw the parallel about the release of the core HR product, and how you're thinking about the competitive landscape, namely, Workday? Thanks very much.Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Yeah. So in terms of shareholder value, the board is continuously meeting about maximizing shareholder value, something we've always done and continue to do. We had a board meeting as recently as last week.With regard to the CHR opportunity, we are seeing decent uptick in the initial launch of the product. Like I said, couple of dozen deals and many, many opportunities specifically focused on that sub-segment I discussed. And we think in much the same way that when we launched Recruiting, it enabled us to stay longer in talent management opportunities that included either learning or performance or both. We're seeing the addition of Cornerstone HR enable us to stay into full suite talent management deals, including learning, performance and recruiting.Michael Nemeroff - Credit SuisseThanks for the answers.Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Walravens from JMP Securities. Your question please.Patrick Walravens - JMP Securities LLCGreat. Thank you. Hey, Adam, what's the opportunity from sort of a machine learning AI point of view with all of that data you have? And what are the challenges, like I'm guessing permissions is one of the challenges, but would love to hear your thoughts there?Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Yeah. So the challenges were both legal and technical, I think we've overcome those over the last couple of years. The opportunity is to take that data and turn it into things that are actionable. So the first thing we did is create a suite of analytics tools, as you know Cornerstone View, Cornerstone Insights, Cornerstone Planning, all of which leverage that dataset to enable our clients to take action on their data, to better visualize the data, to make predictions off the data, to plan based on the data.More recently, what we've been focused on is embedding some of those insights into the product itself. So in much the same way that you don't separately report in Netflix to get a recommendation for the next thing to watch, in Cornerstone, you won't have to run a report to get recommendations on the next training to take. Similarly, we're seeing opportunities around career pathing, recruiting selection, there's opportunities within performance management and most notably because of the dataset we have, in many aspects of learning and development. And so we are getting more aggressive in what we're doing there. And at our Convergence event in June, we're going to be releasing what we believe is the next generation of learning systems leveraging big data.Patrick Walravens - JMP Securities LLCOkay. Cool. Thank you. Brian, how much are these data centers are going to cost?Brian L. Swartz - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Yeah, Pat. We think it'll be about $5 million for both of them, both the one in Frankfurt and Paris. And again, I would expect most of those expenditures to happen in 2018.Patrick Walravens - JMP Securities LLCOkay. Thank you.Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.In total, not each.Brian L. Swartz - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Yeah.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. Your question please.Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLCYes. Thank you, Brian. Any thoughts on how to model stock-based comp expense for 2017 or in terms of new RSU issuance, maybe which way you think that would trend this year?Brian L. Swartz - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Yeah. I mean, I would expect it to kind of go up in line with growth in revenue. So I think we had about $55 million give or take in 2016. We're in the low teens as a percentage of revenue, which is, I think, probably on the lower end of many of our peers. I think in the same ballpark as a percentage of revenue next year makes the most sense. And there is some judgment obviously involved with those numbers obviously and so it can move around a little bit, but in general I think that's a good assumption.Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLCOkay. And then I wanted to follow-up as well on – there was an earlier question on head count growth, but just to try to get a little more fine-grained. In terms of head count growth for 2017, you grew 11% in 2016. Do you think that that'll be faster or slower growth this year?Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.It'll be slightly less. We also see a lot of opportunity as we've done over the last couple of months of reallocating head count from, like I said, lower performing teams to higher performing teams on the sales and marketing front. We're also seeing opportunity to add development capacity given the product initiatives that we have and the opportunities we're seeing in the market.Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLCThank you. The final question I wanted to ask you is just how would you characterize the pricing dynamic in the industry today? I think you had commented on that a bit from a mid-market perspective. But when – I'm trying to understand. So the spread between your user growth is about 26% and then the billings growth at least in terms of the guidance is, call it, somewhere in the teens. To what extent is that tied to the move upmarket where you would have – presumably you would have more volume discounts that would be very natural as opposed to, I guess, any pressure that you might have seen in terms of like for like deal sizes due to competitive factors or any other factors?Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Yeah. I would say specifically the lack of performance in mid-market has resulted in a disconnect between client count growth and user count growth, as well as a reduction or a seemingly reduction in ARPU. But, in fact, if you look at the enterprise segment, we've seen an increase in ASP. And that's due in part to the way we're bundling together products as we sell into that segment.Brian L. Swartz - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Mark, it's Brian. One other thing to keep in mind if you look at any discrete period quarterly or for that matter even annually – and I know you know this. But the revenue in any given year is kind of a function of the sales and retention in prior years. So our user counts are based on when our portals or users or clients actually go live. And it can take three months to six months to implement a client. Hopefully that will decrease. That's our plan with our program accelerate that Adam talked about in the script. So there are going to be a little bit of a timing disconnect when you're looking at revenue growth in any given period and specifically user count growth in the same respective period quarterly or annually. So it's just something to keep in mind as you think about the business.Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLCOkay. Understood. Thank you for taking my questions.Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin from Pacific Crest Securities. Your question, please.Brent Bracelin - Pacific Crest SecuritiesThank you. I had a follow-up on the mid-market. I get that you're taking down expectations as it relates to kind of pricing pressure and competition. I was hoping you could frame maybe the mid-market opportunity. What does it represent as a percentage of bookings today and how important is it to reaccelerate growth as you think about this organic growth rate this quarter of FX adjusted 15%, 16%?Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Yeah. So mid-market is about 10% of the number. And we are being conservative in our expectations about mid-market. There is definitely upside in those numbers. If we see better than expected performance, which is possible given the stability of the team, the improvement in the management layer, the bigger territory opportunity for each individual rep, combined with better tenure of the reps overall, creates definitely an atmosphere with the opportunity for significant upside in that segment. Having said that, we're being cognizant of the results we've had over the last couple of years in mid-market and so we're being muted in our expectations.Brent Bracelin - Pacific Crest SecuritiesFair enough. And would there be ever a moment where you'd just decide to abandon your mid-market efforts? What would it take? And given the customer acquisition costs, kind of the go-to-market, how competitive that environment is? Is this still – you'd give it a couple more years or what are you looking at for proof points of success that would suggest this is a viable opportunity for you?Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Yeah. There's no way we would write it off. We have those proof points. We have hundreds and hundreds of mid-market clients. We have a successful client base and we've seen very good retention in that segment. So the opportunity for us is just to go back to how we were selling in that segment before. If you look at our segment-based sales results going back to the beginning of this decade, you'll notice that we had very good growth in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013. Even 2014, when we restructured the team, we saw a downturn in productivity. And we expect this remerging of that mid-market operation, putting major accounts and national accounts together, to bring us back to the results we were seeing before. And that leads to very good profitability in that segment combined with excellent growth opportunity in that segment. So we have no plans of writing it off.Brent Bracelin - Pacific Crest SecuritiesVery helpful color. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Samad Samana from Stephens, Inc. Your question, please.Samad Samana - Stephens, Inc.Hi, congrats on a good quarter and thanks for taking my questions. So I think, Brian, I heard you mention that billings benefited from better than expected renewals. Can you maybe give us some color on how ACV from new customers grew in the quarter compared to the overall billings growth level and then I have a follow-up?Brian L. Swartz - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Yeah. I mean, the – so the billings obviously came in stronger in Q4 than we had talked about on our last call. It was really just driven as a function of the level of renewals that we expected would come out of the business, principally out of EMEA. Obviously going in on our last call, given some of the headwinds we were facing in EMEA and broader EMEA, specifically the UK, we're obviously, appropriately conservative. So those renewal rates came in stronger than we had expected. In terms of new client sales, sales were obviously down year-over-year, hence the lower numbers, and in part due to some of the challenges we talked about on the last call, principally Brexit and the related impacts to the UK and Continental Europe. And obviously the mid-market was down year-over-year. So I don't know if that – gives you a little bit of color Samad, but it gives you a little bit of a picture of what we saw in the new client logo front, new client ACV front.Samad Samana - Stephens, Inc.That's helpful. And then, can you give us an idea – this is your first year at the company giving full year guidance, can you give us an idea of the level of visibility and comfort you have in the 2017 guidance? And I know you weren't there to give 2016 guidance, but maybe by comparison, how aggressive or how conservative it is relative to when the company provided guidance last year as well?Brian L. Swartz - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Yeah. I mean, it's hard to comment on what the company did last year, because I wasn't there a year ago. But what I will tell you is, and it's consistent with what I've said in the last few quarters that we've spoken, I've gotten to know many of the investors. I think it's important to be as transparent and give you our best view into the future as we can. At the same time, I want to exceed expectations or guidance more frequently than we miss it for a lack of a better word or just hit it. So it's a balancing act of not providing numbers that are so low that you can easily beat them, but also very transparent. So listen, we need to execute on our plan. We feel good about that. We feel good about our opportunities and the size of our pipelines and require a strong sales execution and execution on all the other operational initiatives that we need to achieve to drive both the top line and the bottom line. And we're going to do our very best to do that and exceed the numbers that I've given you here today.Samad Samana - Stephens, Inc.Great, thanks. That's very helpful color.Brian L. Swartz - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.You're welcome.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Furby from William Blair & Company. Your question please.Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLCThanks, guys, and congrats. Brian, I guess to start, can you give a sense when you look at your billings guidance for 2017 in terms of what you're assuming for the U.S. enterprise market. Are you in sort of the 25% range or sort of the growth that you talked about last year at your Analyst Day? I'm just trying to sort of get a sense for the impact from mid-market and international, and I've got a quick follow-up? Thanks.Brian L. Swartz - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Yeah. I mean to give you some – I mean I can't quantify it for you, Justin, but what I can give you is some qualitative commentary, which I hope is helpful. And we had very strong years in 2016 both out of our U.S. enterprise and our global client sales teams or I say global, I mean both the U.S. client sales team which is account sales, account management, as well as our EMEA client sales team, so, those reps that support our existing clients. We had very strong growth in 2016 out of those teams. We expect that to continue into 2017.With respect to EMEA new client sales, I expect that to stabilize and grow again next year. So, obviously we had a lot of challenges in the back half of 2016 related to Brexit. We've now, as of today, announced our new data centers. We think that will add – free-up some of the headwinds and actually provide hopefully quite a bit of tailwinds for that business to perform very well on the new client sales front.We have strong growth from some of our emerging markets which individually are much smaller, but our APJ and LatAm markets very, very critical markets for us to achieve our long-term goals and we expect strong growth out of those teams. Modest expectations in the U.S. mid-market, as Adam talked about, even though we weren't super excited about that market opportunity long-term in light of the performance the last couple of years, I'd assume modest expectations in the outlook.And then strong growth from our kind of public sector and other education-related teams in the U.S. We feel pretty good about their opportunity here in 2017. So, hope that gives you a little bit of color, at least qualitatively, in terms of expectations for this year.Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLCYeah. No, that's helpful. And then, I guess if you look at the guidance for Q1, I think it implies negative billings growth. And just to be clear on your renewal comment, were you suggesting, Brian, that the renewals were better than you expected, meaning deals that came in out of Q1 into Q4 or meaning you thought deals were at risk and you ended up renewing them? I'm just trying to understand the Q1 guidance.And then just more for Adam, in terms of sales and marketing, it seems like you're probably still going to be spending mid-40% of revenue next year and yet growth is now teens growth. It just feels like, relative to most of the peers, that's a lot higher and I guess, I'm wondering if you think that's a function of the market or if it's something that's company-specific that still can be addressed? Thanks.Brian L. Swartz - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.So, yeah, so let me answer your question. So in terms of Q4, it was not early renewal. So it was the latter of what you said, which is simply that, when we were looking at Q4 and the number of renewals that should've come in, that we expected to come in, that came in better than we expected. It was not early renewals from Q4 – Q1 rather that were pulled into Q4.In terms of the Q1 guidance, I think your number is correct. If you take the math that I gave on the call, low-to-mid teens growth off of our $453 million billings number from 2016 and 16% of that would imply Q1 is down a little bit. Do keep in mind Q1 last year was a very strong quarter for us and we talked about that last year. So that's a function of simply a comp issue in year-over-year. So I think that – hopefully, I answered your questions on the guidance. I'll hand it over to Adam.Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLCYeah. Thanks.Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Yeah. And, in term of sales and marketing expense we think there's still opportunity to reduce the sales and marketing expense as a percent of revenue, particularly as we get more efficiency out of the teams. Simultaneously, we don't expect to stay in the low-to-mid-teens. We expect our numbers to be significantly higher than that from a growth perspective over time. And, so we think those two will balance out to a number that makes perfect sense to everybody.Justin A. Furby - William Blair & Co. LLCGot it. Thank you.OperatorThank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of John Byun from UBS. Your question please.John S. Byun - UBS Securities LLCHi. Thank you. I just had a question on the UK and European data centers, and given those will not be up until early next year, are there still any hesitation that you see or that you expect for the rest of the year or based on the announcement, that all of those concerns will be addressed?Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.No. So, I spent some time with the European team and they are confident that the announcement today of those data centers, with the specificity of having data centers both in Germany and France, will mitigate the issue fully.John S. Byun - UBS Securities LLCThank you.OperatorThank you. And, this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Adam Miller, Founder and CEO. Please go ahead.Adam Miller - Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc.Thank you all for the questions and the attention. And we look forward to seeing you all soon. Thank you.OperatorThank you ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in the today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.")

infn.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator Instructions]The first question is from Ehud Gelblum with "
            "Morgan Stanley.Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research DivisionCouple of questions, Ita, if we can go in -- and Tom, if we kind of get to the guidance and a piece of that. So we're looking at high -- mid-high 90s for Q2. How do you sure, and then it picks up in the to 30s or 60 for the significantly and in the back half of the year. How are you sure that the deposit in DTN, I know you said it's part of it seasonality, but how do you know the cost in DTN is going to be picked up by DTN-X? You're trialing 8 people right now. When you say you're going to recognize DTN-X revenue in Q3, is that with all 8 or is that only with like 1 or 2 of them? I'm assuming Cable&Wireless is probably the first one you'll recognize with, but when you saw the order book come down now for DTN, was that -- does it only come down for those 8 that are trialing DTN-X or does it come down with other guys as well?Thomas FallonSo first of all, we have orders for -- from 4 customers that we have already taken. And typically, if we've taken orders from a customer at this point in the cycle, we would ship at a revenue that -- in that current quarter. In this case, we follow on shipping but we won't be able to revenue that until the second half of the year. Two of the customers -- 2 of the opportunities would be for opportunities that are -- it would be incremental or what the DTN will service. So without the DTN-X, we would likely not have one of those deals. Two of the DTN-X POs that we received to date are from customers that had we not had the DTN-X, I believe they would have deployed the DTN because they're investing in the DTN-X as a scalable future versus the DTN wouldn't be able to satisfy it now. So I think that if I look at both the POs we've received, and the 8 trials in addition to the 4 POs, we're seeing a mix of new opportunities that without the DTN-X, we would not have an opportunity for, and we're seeing an opportunity for our current customers to continue a Infinera path by the next-generation architecture. So I feel pretty comfortable that the DTN-X will have an opportunity to sell to both types of customers, new and potential, but also current. And the fact that we are taking orders today, we have 4 to date from 4 different customers, and normally, we'll recognize that revenue. That revenue goes into the back half, which should be incremental, assuming that there's some level of continued internet demand for in general. So all things being equal, we feel pretty comfortable that the DTN revenue will have a continued, ongoing, healthy revenue stream and the DTN-X represents a new opportunity for new customers and opportunities that will be incremental to the company where the DTN would have satisfied it. It's a long-winded way of answering your question. Does that answer your question?Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research DivisionIt sort of does. It does seem as though, from the 2 to the second of those customers, second 2 of those pairs, for which they would have bought the DTN but are now buying the DTN-X, it's somewhat of a push out from Q2 into Q3, Q4 but it's the same that they would have -- same demand that they would have had anyway. It sounds like you only have 2 customers that are actually adding DTN-X in that market expansion from the DTN-X. And so it seems pretty heavy to see $115 million, or let's say $120 million, $125 million revenue quarters in back half of the year, just based on 2 customers that will have incremental. What else gives you confidence?Thomas FallonThere's 2 customers to date, and 6 additional new trials scheduled for Q2. And these customers that we're trialing are pretty big opportunity type customers that typically the DTN would not have allowed us to win. So these are large-scale type customers that could buy a substantive amount of product. I don't anticipate -- certainly all 6 will get us POs in Q2. I'm hopeful that over a period of time, all 6 will give us POs. Not all of that revenue would recognize or happen in a year, but some of it will. And the DTN-X is opening a new class of customer and a caliber of customer that is trialing with us we are pretty satisfied with.Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research DivisionIt sounds as though we're counting on those customers, whatever push on those 6, the trial in Q2 to come through and push to that $230 million to $260 million. So my guess is if they're trialing at Q2, that revenue doesn't get recognized at Q4. So it sounds like we're probably hugging $100 million in Q3 and up a much, much bigger number in Q4. Is that right?Thomas FallonWell, I'm not going to give you our Q3 number. We gave you -- we spent a lot of time looking at what the opportunities are at the back half of the year. And as you know, the fidelity between quarters is challenging. But we feel comfortable with the $230 million to $260 million range in the back half. I did mention that we are in contract negotiations with a couple of other people, so it's not just we have 4 orders and we've got to start to work on some others. We are in the midst of contract negotiations with some other customers that I am highly confident will close this quarter.Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research DivisionOkay, great. One last thing, if I could. The competition, the competitive environment that you both talked about, that you both talked about. Is this -- it sounds like it's worse than it was 6 months ago. What kind of -- where -- what areas do you see it in? Do you see it in 10-gig as well, or is it only in 100-gig? Or do you see it -- is it from one customer or one competitor in particular or is the entire environment predicated it?Thomas FallonYes, I see, as we have said that for a period of time, we have been competing aggressively with the DTN and have had to make commercial terms that would allow us to compete where we didn't have 100-gig. So that's been fairly challenging and that's not new. What is -- well, I'm surprising a little bit, is that there is a lot of pricing competition for 100-gig footprint. And it seems to be coming more intense in certain areas, certain markets like submarine, it's, I would say, the most intense. And I think that people view like we do that the opportunity to fill fiber capacity for a longer period of time with more bandwidth, you have to win that footprint. So I think that there is a level of competition to make sure that there's an opportunity to create the fill based upon harder commercial terms upfront.Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research DivisionWouldn't that competitor feel the same way that you do? And therefore, aren't we stuck in a situation with no national equilibrium?Thomas FallonI assume the competitor feels the same way I do. I think that the opportunity for this industry always is the fill is where you are allowed to make a reasonable return and footprint right now, during a expansion of market I think is viewed as critical by the participants in that market. I think it's going to be fairly competitive environment.OperatorThe next question is from George Notter with Jefferies.George C. Notter - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research DivisionI guess, just back on that prior question. So you're talking about revenues in Q2 in the high 90s. How many customers do you think you'll really experience and overhang in DTN demand from because of the DTN-X? And I guess I'm wondering, as we go out, we've got certainly many, many other customers in the folds of DTN. Is it logical that those folks potentially start looking at the DTN-X, you'd have additional overhang and demand on your hands as we go out through the balance of the year?Thomas FallonWell, I think, the way I view it, is it's not -- most of our customers who are interested in the DTN-X, it's not like they flip a switch and they move from DTN to DTN-X. There's a different class of product, the DTN-X 400-gig capacity, a line card, and the DTN-X has 500 gig. It is a different class of product. Do -- have people been buying the DTN, awaiting for the DTN-X? And some range of customers have been because they see the ability to utilize the DTN and it continues to be a market leader in 10-gig and provide a very good economic solution. I think that -- I don't view it as much as they're making a decision to not buy the DTN. I see it as a decision that they're making an infrastructure, a network infrastructure that can scale to multi-terabit and in certain parts of their network, that's going to be mandatory. In other parts of their network, the DTN is going to continue to provide an exceptionally compelling value proposition. I don't know any customer that I have today for the DTN that is not going to buy more DTNs because of the DTN-X. That somebody is putting in a new core to their backbone or if somebody is putting in a massive new region, the DTN-X is a great way to do that, and DTNs are still going to be extraordinarily useful in regional, metro and in certain core applications where the bandwidth from the fiber is just not required.George C. Notter - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research DivisionGot it. Okay. So then if I were able to split out -- if I just step back and I look at the 2 classifications of customer opportunities, I mean, how would you parse that? Do you think that 50% of your current revenue today on the DTN would be ongoing over time and have a long tail to it, and you grow the DTN-X on top of that? Or is it the higher percentage or lower percentage? I mean, how should I parse the 2 opportunities?David F. WelchGeorge, it's Dave Welch. Maybe I can contribute to the answer. The majority of DTN-X revenue in business that we have is going to continue forward. As we've had in any of our products, customers go through in cycles of looking at either adding new routes, lighting up a new rail or a new fiber on top of a current network that is growing. It's in those opportunities that are evaluating to put DTN-X in as opposed to DTN. So all of the fill associated with everything that we've deployed before, the lowest cost addition of bandwidth is to continue to do that. We expect that to go on, and that's going to, and that takes years to fully fill the deployed networks. So if -- you're right, it is a -- I put it in kind of a 15%, 20% of our DTN revenue or evaluating DTN-X proportion of that. And the rest of it is perfectly happy with the product that they have. They're going to continue on. And the majority of the DTN-X is frankly bring in new markets and new customers, and new applications of a product, of a scale that we haven't had before. And that's what most of the customers that we are bringing in, they are looking at their existing customers but they're looking at DTN-X for applications that we've never competed with before.OperatorThe next question is from Kevin Dennean with Citi.Kevin J. Dennean - Citigroup Inc, Research DivisionJust a couple of quick housekeeping questions to begin with. On services, Ita, I heard you mentioned that services were down off of the top sequential comp because of some catch-up revenues. There's a lot of utilities, services over time, should we think that about the service revenue snapping back 2 quarter or in that second quarter or do we stay around these levels?Ita M. BrennanYes. I mean, I think if you look at Q4, that was particularly high, right? We had a good level of deployments happening in the quarter and we also have some catch-up stuff and some large annuity contracts, right? So I think Q4 was actually higher than our typical run rate. If you look back over time, I think the Q1 range we probably put some more deployments, probably a little bit higher than that. But that's probably more of a typical run rate for us on a normal quarter.Kevin J. Dennean - Citigroup Inc, Research DivisionAnd then on services gross margins, how should we think about that going forward? What's kind of the normalized range there? Because I would imagine that the gross margin level this quarter was a little depressed just on kind of revenue scale?Ita M. BrennanYes. I mean, those margins do move around a bit depending on the deployment levels mix in there, right? I mean, I think if you look back historically, it's been anywhere from about say 58, up to as high as 65, 66, right? So that's been kind of the typical range. Now so the 60 is, it's not completely out of bounds, right? But it does have that range too depending on how much deployment stuff we're actually doing in the quarter. But the deployments will have lower margin than say the annuity service which has almost 100% margin, right?Kevin J. Dennean - Citigroup Inc, Research DivisionOkay, and then question for me is on gross margins and the impact of ramping your 100-G PIC. So it sounds like a little bit of a drag current quarter, maybe it persists for a while. You mentioned that you expect to drive cost down on a -- I think you used the word satisfactorily. But how should we think about the progression of gross margins through the year?Ita M. BrennanYes. I mean, I think...Kevin J. Dennean - Citigroup Inc, Research DivisionAnd how big, I'm sorry to interrupt, but how big a drag are we seeing right now?Ita M. BrennanYes, I mean, if you think about our gross margin through the end of the year, we've only talked about this 2 to 3 points of kind of ramping DTN-X overhead rate, if you like that's in there. And I think that's there probably through the end of the year, maybe it starts to get better in Q4, right, get a little bit in Q4, and then kind of burns off as we start to kind of be truly in full production and looking into the new year, right? So I think about the impact of the DTN-X through the kind of the end of the year is. We've got some impact in Q2. When we actually ship those initial units, we'll have a little bit more impact in Q3. And then in Q4, we should be starting to get back to some of the approach, the more normal production, but still not fully ramped up and not fully optimized, right?Kevin J. Dennean - Citigroup Inc, Research DivisionOkay. And last question for me, in your OpEx guidance, that's includes OSMINE cost?Ita M. BrennanYes. I mean, what you'll see with OSMINE is it's going to be in every quarter probably between now and through the end of the year at least, right, and so it's for smaller amounts but it's spread out over a period of time. We had already kind of included that in our guidance that there would be some OSMINE activities so really we're just kind of fine tuning that, but it's always kind of been built into the OpEx guidance.OperatorThe next question is from Rod Hall with JPMorgan.Rod B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionI just wanted to drill into the pipeline a little bit more, just to make sure I understand it. So I understand that you've got these 8 trials running. I wonder if you could say whether those are limited by the availability of equipment or is that the total number of people that are interested in trialing the DTN-X right now? Just some kind of indication, where we are in the process of spending trials up. And if you could elaborate on the -- maybe how many people you've got active in the DTN-X sales pipeline, that would also be useful. Just kind of figure out what the potential for additional trials is and how the whole sales cycle might progress?David F. WelchYes, let me -- this is Dave Welch. Let me see if I can answer that for you. And I probably will not be able to answer it satisfactorily. But the interesting thing that backed off and talk about high level, the interest of the DTN-X is great. There is a significant -- across our customer base, they see various values of that is that we have, at the beginning of the quarter, where we are today, we have a number of committed trials to come in either in our lab or their lab to be able to execute on what I would call the present as a qualification process trial as opposed to a early evaluation trial. So in that discussion, many early evaluation trials that we engage in into varying degrees with our customers. If we look at our 100-plus customers that we've engaged with over the years, we're not going to have 100 guys walk in here and evaluate the product. We're going to have -- it typically is a larger capacity network and they're going to come here and evaluate our product and they're going to try and time that for when they see new applications and new capacity builds in their cycle to come on out. And I -- so it's not just the availability of the product that dictates when they but it. It's the availability of the product in times when they need it, when they need to make that technology transition. So the interest is high. I don't want to go through and quantify that. But we have a -- I think the general mixture of what we see of new customers, new applications and current customers and old applications with current customers, that make sure that we are presenting to you is fairly consistent as we look forward .Bob BlairJust to clarify kind of what you're saying there. The A trials, you guys have talked about, those you classify as qualification trials and then you're saying there's a bunch of other customers that are in early evaluation stage is on the product is that the right way to think about it?Thomas FallonYes, this is Tom. The trials that we're doing, the 8 we're talking about is a level of typically takes couple of their engineers, customer engineers, 3 to 5 days, and it's is typically linked to a deployment opportunity that they are truly evaluating a product against. That is a, what we consider a trial here. So there's one finite capacity, but more importantly, there's a customer desire to make a final decision on a product to go through this level of testing. In addition to that, as Dave pointed out, there are a lot of demonstrations, there are a lot of customers coming in. Will they get a couple hour lab tour, and be able to see the gear working, play with it for couple of hours. That's for them to get a sense of what is available. And as they're going into some type of RFI or some RFQ point, whether they want to include Infinera on that. And then above that, we have just pipeline coating. So we have a lot of pipeline activity where our sales guys are bringing us opportunities, responding to bids, depending on our success with that bid, that could either lead to a demo where they could test and say that we want to have Infinera have a shortlist and then that would to a trial. So the trials we are doing are fairly late-stage in the cycle and they're fairly intense from a customer perspective on the amount of time commitment they had to spend, both here and in preparation for it, because they typically have; generated a test plan of what they want to do when they're here.Rod B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionOkay. And you're saying, Tom, that it is capacity limited. So that, if you had unlimited capacity in your labs, you'd probably, you might have more than 8 trials.Thomas FallonYes, I don't know. It's hard to say. I mean, you can only do so many. It's not infinite. A trial takes -- a successful trial takes about a week. So we're doing about 8 this quarter, a quarter is 13 weeks. Now if somebody came in and said, listen, I really want to trial this, we have an opportunity, we're going to take that trial. If they say we have an opportunity for Q4, they'll probably say we want to trial it in Q3. I'm trying to cram as many in as possible. I'd rather be horribly successful with the ones were doing.OperatorThe next question is from Alex Henderson with Miller Tabak.Alex B. Henderson - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research DivisionSo I just wanted to talk a little bit about the trajectory of margins and the pricing commentary. It's quite obvious when you look at the results out of Ciena over the last 18 to 24 months that part of their problem is that they've been shipping at very low cost, a lot of chassis, and not shipping a lot of blades into them because they go out 40% loaded. And it takes them at least 1 year to 1.5 years from the time they get shipped to those chassis out to absorb that initial slug of capacity, so which end up with this chassis versus TAM mix being quite negative. Is it not reasonable to think that if you have successful DTN-X, that you would see a similar window to absorb the initial capacity that goes out loaded on the DTN-X boxes and therefore, active pricedown to get that valuable footprint in order to have the opportunity to sell TAM into the future periods?David F. WelchOkay, let me see if I can do some insight on that. There's absolutely a variation in gross margin between first-in cost and fill cost. Our product architecture and our product cost structure is different than our competitors, and that allows a different profile and a different recovery period from first-in cost. What Tom tried to infer in his commentary is that the upside margin for Infinera, based on our advanced technology and our photonic integration that we're vertically integrated on our Coherent technologies, et cetera, allows us to have a gross margin recovery that we believe is much faster than some of our competitors out there.Alex B. Henderson - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research DivisionI wasn't trying to imply that it would be the same margin structure, but the structure that I just depicted where you're talking about shipping primarily chassis in a new product launch for a better part of the year before you start to see the absorption of the initial capacity that shipped along with the chassis on the first install to get the TAM sales and that after the tax and if that's 12 months, that would imply that you're not going to get the high-margin TAM revenue in until well into 2013.David F. WelchYes, I think that the -- keep in mind, our system is made up of 3 pieces, there is common chassis, there is long-haul bandwidth, which is what our photonic integrate circuits deliver, and then there's a tributary access. Our tributary access is a smaller granularity that our 500-gigabits. And our initial deployments will go out with a small capacity of tributary bandwidth, and but they will quickly deplete that tributary bandwidth and will start adding on, and so our margin profile, it won't be 12 months for margin recovery.Thomas FallonWe also -- it's important to remember that the optical that they referred to, the DTN-X completely compatible with the optical layer we've been shipped, selling for a long time. And that invariably carries a very low margin. So customers who already have our optical infrastructure, we will have the opportunity to upgrade them and achieve margin recovery much faster than if you're deploying the overall optical layer in addition.Alex B. Henderson - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research DivisionOkay. Second question, could you talk to -- you've got a very large install base of customers. My count's a little over 100 now. Can you tell me what portion of those would actually have a network that could handle a DTN-X sized platform? Because obviously the bandwidth is substantial compared to some of the smaller competitor -- smaller service providers?David F. WelchYes. That's a, it's a little bit of a hard question to answer and I think the pertinent question is to answer more on a dollar basis as opposed to a number of customer basis. And I think that being -- anyone who is truly on the long-haul business will, at some point in their cycle, have an interest in the DTN-X. Our customers that are in the metro, more of a metro or metro regional network, their reach is going to -- it will take longer for those capacity demands in areas that are more fiber-rich to take advantage of it. Our business is, it's not a super majority, but it's certainly a majority of our business is through long-haul carriers and subsea carriers that have an interest in that immediately.Alex B. Henderson - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research DivisionOver half of your customer base is still metro or regional, and therefore, would not be likely candidates for even moving to a DTN-X. So when we look at the customer base of 102 and say, okay, half of that is 50, we're doing 8. It gives us a better handle on what portion of the customer base is viable candidate for a trial?David F. WelchYes, I don't think, I'm not sure I can give you what the accurate number is on the quantity of customers at this point. So I had to defer that question another time.Thomas FallonYou also need to be careful of assuming that every customer is going to trial it. If it's a DTN customer today, there's a reasonable percentage of them that will not do a trial. They will do a first office application, 2 of the first POs we have were not based upon them coming in and doing trialing. They know our gear, they know the software releases, based upon a previous release. They're very comfortable, saying we're going to roll this out based upon our history with the company.Alex B. Henderson - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research DivisionOne last question and I'll cede the floor. Because it's on the same basic concept which is -- can you talk a little bit about what portion of your customer base that are looking at the DTN-X product would have a acceptance criteria that would cause an extended delay in the timing of the recognition of the revenues? I know you're saying you're going to have revenues in this back half of the year, but are some of the installations in the back half also going to be deferred into 2013 for revenue rec purposes?Ita M. BrennanYes, I mean, I think we talked about before obviously very much with existing customers, with existing contracts, and what we're seeing is those customers are not really trying to go change the terms of their contracts. So if we have customers in that book who are taking revenue and allowing us to take revenue on shipments and on receipt, we're not seeing people comment they want to change that for the DTN-X, right? I think for new customers, they haven't used the products before, then you will see a longer acceptance period.Thomas FallonAnd on submarine, invariably where there's new product or old product, they want to see the submarine link up and running for a period of time before they will sign off on it. And that's to me less to do with the DTN-X and more to do with the submarine market.OperatorThe next question is from Sanjiv Wadhwani with Stifel, Nicolaus.Sanjiv Wadhwani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research DivisionTom, I just want to take a crack at the second half trajectory. If you look at your revenue run rate over the last 6 quarters or so, and this is rounded up to about $100 million a quarter, if you're guiding to $230 million to $260 million for the second half, and if you assume that $100 million comes from the DTN every quarter, does that mean that the DTN-X is going to be between $30 million and $60 million for the second half?Thomas FallonWell, the way you did it, it would. We just spent a full day with all of our sales team on rolling up and looking at very specific DTN-X opportunities. We are typically hesitant to give out guidance beyond the quarter. We have not done that. We're doing that this time because, quite frankly, we think Q2 is an anomaly. Revenue is down. But we have the opportunity. We've won 4 new DTN-X customers. We have a pipeline full of trials that are coming and we are in negotiation with a number of other DTN-X opportunities. We either believe that we are going to win those and what we're going to start shipping and taking orders for in Q1 and Q2, and start shipping in Q2, translates into new opportunities or it doesn't. We believe it does. So we wanted to share with you our observation. And it's based upon a roll up of what we've done with all of our various regions, on the opportunities that they see, both for the DTN and the DTN-X. And the reason we are creating a kind of out-of-process guidance for that is because I don't believe that revenue reflection of Q2 is representative of the opportunity that we see with DTN-X. We started taking orders for DTN-X in Q1. We never have 1.5 quarters until we recognize revenue. This is an anomaly on there. And quite frankly, any forecast can be wrong. We would not give that forecast unless we had done the work and the diligence of being able to say this is what we can touch and see.Sanjiv Wadhwani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research DivisionGot it, fair enough. I guess, the other question, on the OSMINE certification as it's going through. You've already done some prior certification with Qwest and I'm trying to figure out if it's -- this is DTN-X with the same customer, brand-new customer? Any color there?Thomas FallonWell, I'm not going to give any color there. We've done 2 OSMINE releases. We did our release 3. With OSMINE, we did our release 6. And OSMINE and that was a customer request. OSMINE is a non-trivial expenditure in the DTN. We did it based upon a specific request from a customer. We are also doing, as Ita has said, we had baked OSMINE into our planning, but we're also doing at a specific customer request and that's all I'm going to say about it.Operator[Operator Instructions]The next question is from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionI just wanted to ask another follow-up, on the second half trajectory. So can you just give us a sense for when you think begin DTN-X revenues will cross over the halfway point in terms of the percent of the total? I mean, it sounds like that might even happen exiting this year, but do you think that will be exiting this year or more first half of next year?Ita M. BrennanYes, We're not in a position to do that yet, Simona. We will provide more color kind of on the product split as we can report the actuals, but we're not going to try to project that at this time.Sanjiv Wadhwani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research DivisionOkay. And then a couple of follow-ups on the margins in the next few quarters as well. I think there was some helpful discussion there on how long you think it will take for the proportion of common equipment to TAMs to normalize and it sounds like you thought that would be less than a year before, that aspect of pressure on margins is released. And please correct me if I misunderstood that, but the follow-up is, there's also kind of the yield aspect in terms of your PICs which are, obviously, new technology and much larger. So how long do you think before kind of the yield and the manufacturing aspects of your new PICs normalizes back up to what your historical 10-gig or 100-gig PICs have been?Ita M. BrennanI mean, I think in the comments and the remarks, we are seeing good traction kind of in the FAB around the costs and it is trending kind of as we expected, right? So I think we have -- we'd originally guide at 40% gross margin for the year, with kind of some of the volatilities that we're seeing and I think we'll be somewhat below that, but not -- if we get the top line in there and the revenue growth that we're projecting then, not significantly off of that, right? if you look beyond that, I think what starts to happen is we take out some of the DTN-X overhead type margin impacts that we've had. You'll start to ramp some volume. And then you really do start to see kind of the flow-through on the model, right, where you start to truly ramp the FAB and have leverage the fixed cost there in the FAB, and then you can start seeing margins expand again through kind of next year.Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionRight. But that's more of an overhead comment. What about just the yields themselves? Somewhere the variable cost is about to the fixed cost drag?Ita M. BrennanYes, I mean, the yields are ramping along kind of a similar relative curve as they did with kind of the Gen 1 and Gen 2 products, right? So we would expect to hit entitlement yields sometime next year, right? I'll ask Dave to kind of maybe talk a litte more about...David F. WelchOur yields on our PICs, I caution you that the question you're trying to get at is what the cost structure is of our business yields, of our PICs, are -- they're ahead of schedule, they're fine. The PICs work, the usual capabilities and technologies there and we can make as much as we need of it. And we sell systems, we sell networks. These are highly complex things that which the PIC is an enabler for cost structure and elsewhere in the system, but it is not a dominant cost structure. We are not a component company.Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionOkay, fair enough. And then just last quick one. And I realize this might have been too recent to kind of have all the details, but in terms of the proposed acquisition of Cable&Wireless by Vodafone, is there any change there that you think might happen relative to your involvement either in terms of incremental opportunities at Vodafone or maybe a change in how Vodafone wants to run that piece of the Cable&Wireless business?Thomas FallonYes, I think there's 2 parts of the question in my mind. One does it affect what our current plans are in the short term with rolling out the DTN-X with Cable&Wireless? I don't believe that there's any impact to the current plan we have of rolling out the DTN-X against the current contract with Cable&Wireless. For longer term, it's a much bigger question. I don't think that the acquisition will close. Earliest will be August. I think latest is October. And I think that more than likely, new decisions will probably have a period of reluctance to make big commitments to anything. I feel very comfortable that the current PO and plan of expansion with their EPEG network is on track. Beyond that, somehow I think it's too early for anybody to say what will happen.OperatorThe next question is from Michael Genovese with MKM Partners.Michael Genovese - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionTom, you spoke earlier in the prepared remarks pretty enthusiastically about the optical reboot cycle and the expansion for optical. And then meanwhile, we're on this side, pretty angsty about carrier CapEx this year. Is it strong? Is it weak? Is it front-end loaded? Is it back-end loaded? Is there an optical cycle or is there not? So when you talk about all this efficiency being made, this capacity going into the network and capital dollars being spent, is there something that's happening this year in your view or is it more of a 2013, 2014 event?Thomas FallonWell, I think it's mixed. I mean, a lot of discussion happens around AT&T and Verizon CapEx. And for good and bad, we're not supposed to do that right now. My commentary on kind of optical reboot is based upon 2 things. I just see, quite frankly, the investment happening in wireless, the investment that has to at some point translate into core networks. I see what's happening with the data center distribution. I see what's happening with all of those types of activities. And at some point, there has to be a sort of CapEx. That's part of it. The second part is I see the amount of quoting and activity that we have. And it's quite substantial right now. Certain areas of the market are making decisions without question for this year, and those include cable, those include submarine, those include a number of activities that are happening in Europe. There are some very substantive builds being planned. So that is outside of, quite frankly, in the market of what is AT&T and Verizon planned spending on CapEx. Those are very big numbers. I certainly anticipate and hopefully the DTN-X will help us boost the progress of having -- that have to remain to our conversation. But I see the opportunities and a lot of people are saying Europe is soft. Our Europe in Q1 was actually pretty darn good, and we see lots of activity there. I think people are making investments where their networks are needing to expand for new services, whether they are low-latency commercial services or cloud services or just video content. I see substantive investments being made.Michael Genovese - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionGreat, that's a great answer. And then just a follow-up question. But early in your response from an earlier question you talked about OSMINE -- I'm sorry, you talked about evaluations of DTN-X, early stage to late stage. And typically, where in that process would a request from a customer to OSMINE, would it be earlier or later in the evaluation process?Thomas FallonIt is socialized early in it, and it is finalized in a contract phase where you'll do it or I'm not buying from you.Michael Genovese - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionSo but along with that, I mean, just generally speaking, I mean, so they say you do that or I'm not buying from you. Do they promise you anything...Thomas FallonYes. Quite frankly, they're very reasonable people. They use OSMINE certification to help run the back end of their businesses. They have no desire for us to indiscriminately spend money on OSMINE if they don't have a business need that they think the DTN-X can help solve. We're doing it based upon the strong belief that they have every intention to roll out the DTN-X. OSMINE is a gate to that. Obviously, the product has to go into their network, and it will go into their network, but it has to be successful when it goes into their network. So that's up to us to make that happen. And I have every confidence that we will make that happen. So I believe, OSMINE to me isn't a threat, it's an opportunity that basically says we're going to roll out your stuff in the network. But for us to mass deploy your stuff, you've got to do it in the context that makes our business successful and you have to do OSMINE for that. And that's why we are doing it. And before when we rolled out OSMINE historically, both release 3 and release 6, it's been an extremely good investment for us.Thank you, all, for joining us today on the call. We appreciate your interest and questions. We look forward to keeping you informed on our progress in the months ahead as we execute our significant opportunities for the DTN-X and our strategy to win the marketplace. Have a great day.OperatorThank you for participating in today's conference call. You may disconnect at this time.")

infn.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Rod Hall with"
            " JPMorgan.Ashwin Kesireddy - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionIt's Ashwin filling in for Rod. One question is about your DTN-X customers. You said that you completed 10 customer trials. But you also gave a metric around the number of purchase orders you received. And also you've mentioned that some of the customers bypassed the trial phase. So can you give us a number of how many customers actually bypassed that phase? And is there any North American customer in that -- in the purchase orders you currently have?Thomas J. FallonSo I think you asked a couple of questions. One, can we tell you which customers bypassed the process. I will only tell you that it's been customers that we have been working with for a number of years. They have large installed base DTN and it's in markets that we have served for a long time. It's a combination of mostly domestic, but also at least one international customer that bypassed the typical trial phase.Ashwin Kesireddy - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionI was just going to ask about the North American customer trial. There was this one Tier 1 service provider, which was present with you around the States, had shown some interest about -- interest in the DTN-X platform. Can you give us some update there?Thomas J. FallonI think you're probably referencing Verizon, and we continued to, as you, I think, probably know, have good interactions with Verizon. They have publicly continued to endorse both the architecture that we are supporting, converged network around both OTN and packet, and they've endorsed the direction we're going. I am not at liberty to discuss any further details about that potential customer engagement.Ashwin Kesireddy - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionAll right. Then final question is on the gross margin. Last quarter, you mentioned that you are seeing a lot of pressure on the pricing to win the initial footprint. Now you're saying you're continuing to see that pricing pressure. I'm just wondering if the pricing pressure actually increased. Or is it almost stable?Ita M. BrennanYes, I mean, it's always hard to kind of create relative measures around that. I mean, I think we're continuing to see just similar interest in that initial footprint and drive to win that initial footprint. So I don't know if anything has changed from last quarter's call.Thomas J. FallonThis is Tom. I have at one point of clarification. We've said it's a very competitive environment now for a number of quarters. A part of that we have linked to the fact that we were competing with platforms that offered 10 and 40 Gig against a market that was very focused on 100. So we said we are making some commercial decisions to offer our customers a good solution around our, then available, 10 and 40 Gig. Now that 100 is available and shipping, we continue to see 100 Gig pricing pressure, which usually for a new technology, there's a period of time where that is less intense. My view is it's probably been less intense over the last couple of years. But as the market opens up now to at least a few people pursuing and delivering 100 gig Coherent, the competition for 100-gig technologies is pretty significant.Operator[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley.Jeremy David - Morgan Stanley, Research DivisionIt's Jeremy David speaking on behalf of Ehud Gelblum. I guess a couple of questions on -- you don't take the -- on the second half revenue guidance from $245 million at the midpoint to $237.5 million. Now what's the reason? Is it just macro? Is it just a delay in purchase orders for the DTN-X or greater fallout than you expected in DTN orders? Can you give us some visibility into that?Thomas J. FallonCertainly. This is Tom, Jeremy. If I look at -- there's 2 things that are happening: one, are we creating traction with the DTN-X; and are we winning customers at or above the rate we had anticipated? And as I stated in my statements, I am extremely excited and enthusiastic about the role, I think, that DTN-X is going to play in the market, short and long term. So from a traction perspective, from a customer receptivity perspective, I am extremely bullish. Having said that, and I think you're seeing this from almost everybody who I hear announcements from, the macroeconomic environment is certainly uncertain, and I think that there is, without question, delays of purchase decisions, and we are also concerned about the ability to control when customers accept any DTN-X platform that they might buy from us and deploy. So the change of the guidance is reflective of our view that the macroeconomics are very uncertain, and there's inherent risk there and our inability to control when certain customers will be able to recognize revenue from them accepting the product.Jeremy David - Morgan Stanley, Research DivisionOkay, great. That's very helpful. And then could you comment on the revenue mix this quarter between the DTN and DTN-X? I know you just started shipping it in June so it might be very -- it might be single-digit mix?Ita M. BrennanYes, there's no DTN-X revenue, Jeremy, in the...Jeremy David - Morgan Stanley, Research DivisionThere's no DTN-X, okay. What about next quarter? What is that? Can you give us some guidance around the mix between DTN and DTN-X, broadly speaking?Ita M. BrennanYes, I mean, as we said, meaningful so I think, we will start to see a good ramp on the DTN-X revenues. We're not really going to break that out between the 2 platforms because, I mean, essentially for us a network is a network. And we'll be selling DTN and DTN-X as a solution to these customers. So we're not going to try and track that between the 2 platforms.Jeremy David - Morgan Stanley, Research DivisionOkay. And finally, you mentioned you will not be disclosing trials anymore for the DTN-X going forward. You had mentioned 10 trials last quarter, and you had 10 purchase orders, presumably some of them came from customers who are already using you. Are there any trials that were not successful? And if any, anything that we can learn from those trials that may not have lead to purchase orders?Ita M. BrennanYes, I mean, I think some of them are still in play, as I look at the list of trials. We don't see anybody where we would say that we have absolutely lost out on the opportunity. But some of those opportunities are definitely still in play.Thomas J. FallonYes, I'll be more clear. You asked if any of them were unsuccessful. None of them were unsuccessful, and I would qualify that I was very satisfied with the results of the trials, certainly the ones that resulted in POs. But I was also as satisfied that potential customers who have not made a purchase decision yet walked away with an exceptionally good feeling about the product, the architecture, the company. So I think they were all successful. That's one of the reasons we are going to break apart not talking about trials because trials come at many different times. Sometimes customers are about to deploy something. Sometimes people are thinking about deploying something and sometimes people are just evaluating a longer-term architectural direction, and they will not understand what we are doing. It might impact that strategy. That could be a year or 2 years away. I think the most relevant thing to think about is customer wins and market share of 100 Gig moving forward. We will talk about customer wins, and we are going to talk about 100-gig market share because we think we're going to have something we can be very proud of. Just for Q3, we do have a number of trials that are scheduled, so I don't want anybody to think that we're walking away because the metric wouldn't look good. We have approximately the same number of trials scheduled in Q3 as we had scheduled in Q2, but we just don't think it provides great clarity as a predictor of short-term business.OperatorOur next question comes from Jody Farquhar with Jefferies & Company.Jody Farquhar - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research DivisionThis is Jody in for George Notter. On the back of the commentary on the strong order book, I guess, any granularity you could provide around book-to-bill metric? And then also, I noticed we had a downtick in the deferred revenue number on the quarter. So any commentary around those would be greatly appreciated.Ita M. BrennanYes, I mean, it's difficult to give you a meaningful book-to-bill just because our business tends to be large opportunities that kind of have their own cycle time. I think the best book-to-bill we can give you is to look at the revenue guidance, which essentially is there and out through the end of the year between both the second half guidance and the Q3 numbers, right? The downtick on deferred revenues, we did recognize some deferred services revenues and some deferred product revenue in the quarter. We'll start to see that scroll again starting in Q3 as we start to bill kind of service contracts for next year, so it's typical for it to come down. We had a couple of larger amounts come out of that this quarter. And then we should start to see it build again in Q3 and Q4.Jody Farquhar - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research DivisionOkay, great. Final question on DTN and DTN-X overlap, going back to that. I believe the commentary on the last update was that 15% to 20% of this customer base maybe there's an overlapping customer there. Is this -- any update on that number given today's commentary? Does this look like something like 25%, 30% overlap now? Any further commentary on that?Thomas J. FallonI don't remember the commentary saying that there's only a 15% or 20% overlap. So I'm going to have to take a note, Jody, and get back to you. I believe that a substantial portion of the customers that buy from us today at a dollar basis will also be interested in the DTN-X. I don't think that all of their applications necessarily will have the DTN-X be the right answer because it has such a magnificent scale and magnificent capacity, and that costs money. So there are certain applications that the DTN is going to be better suited for, but I would say at a dollar basis, more like 80% of the purchase dollars we get today would come from customers who would have opportunities for DTN-X.Operator[Operator Instructions]Thomas J. FallonOn behalf of Infinera, I would like to thank you very much for your time. I look forward to giving you updates over the next quarter and look forward to hopefully seeing you in December. Thank you.OperatorThank you for participating in today's conference. Please disconnect at this time.")
# 2012 q3
infn.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Simona "
            "Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionJust wanted to follow up a little bit on the commentary around the customer wins with the DTN-X. I noticed you mentioned a North America Tier 1 customer, and obviously, you've been undergoing OSMINE. And I believe a couple of months ago, you'd mentioned that you would announce this customer later this year. Can we still expect you to announce who that customer is? And is this something that at this point has been awarded to you as a design win? And if you can maybe just expound on what parts of the network or what applications it will be used for.Thomas J. FallonYes, Simona, this is Tom. This is the same one we have referenced for a period of time, since the last call, 2 things: One, we have said that OSMINE certification would begin in Q4 and complete sometime in Q1. We've now pulled in the certification to our expectation is OSMINE certification will be complete by the end of Q4. While we've been awarded a -- this project, it's a long-haul application in a Tier 1, and we do intend to announce it this year with their permission.Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionOkay, terrific. And then following up on Ita's comments on the profile of growth margins which are being impacted here in near term by a faster ramp of the common equipment for DTN-X, to the best to have visibility at this point, when would we expect gross margins to come back maybe to the mid-40s, which I would assume would reflect a more normalized mix?Ita M. BrennanI think Simona, certainly to the next couple of quarters, we're going to have kind of production ramp impacts plus a healthy common equipment mix. Once we get through that, then we should start to see margins improve. And you're right, I think probably a mid-40% range is a good steady state with growth target. We haven't exactly pegged when that would be, but we just started seeing progress towards that through kind of next year.Thomas J. FallonThe other thing -- additional comment, Simona. As I mentioned in my script, right now, we have the opportunity not to upgrade an existing network on a single wave of 100 Gig, but our customers are deploying -- upgrading their entire network with new platforms, new chassis, new line infrastructure, and that's going to allow it to be an Infinera 100 Gig, 500 Gig super-channel network. The best thing we can do for now and for the near term is to win as much footprint as we possibly can. We've been pretty clear that we are going to drive the company to have market share leadership so that we have the opportunity to fill those chassis over a very, very long period of time. While our absolute commitment is to create a company that has a margin premium to the industry based on our technology over the next period of time, my absolute commitment is to grow our market share as fast as possible while maintaining a good conservative view of cash use.Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionSure. And then just lastly, I was a little bit surprised by the guidance for next year, 10% to 20%, which is a bit below where consensus is right now especially given the comments around the Tier 1 win and the stronger traction in DTN-X and also some of the Dell'Oro forecast you were citing. So can you just kind of help bridge those numbers for us?Ita M. BrennanYes, I mean I think if you look at industry kind of growth rates right now, they're somewhere in that kind of 7% to 10%, so that range of 10% to 20% is really saying we'll grow roughly 2x the market. I don't think there's any doubt that we are winning opportunities and gaining new customers. It's really a matter of timing and how those opportunities ramp and how the revenue ramps with those opportunities. So it's kind of our current visibility to that range. We'll obviously continue to update that as we move forward.OperatorOur next question comes from George Notter with Jefferies.George C. Notter - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research DivisionI guess I wanted to ask about the pipeline of DTN-X opportunities. I think you'd said you had 16 purchase commitments now total. Can you just sort of talk about what you see beyond that in the pipeline? Is there a larger number of customers presumably you're engaged with? Any way you could kind of quantify that, that gives a sense for it? And if you have been turned down with particular customer opportunities, were there particular reasons why customers maybe are looking elsewhere relative to the DTN-X on the 100 Gig?David F. WelchGeorge, maybe I can answer, this is Dave Welch. We're seeing a very robust marketplace for DTN-X right now. We have a large number of engagements at various stages within the process from early demonstrations to trials to field trial deployments that are going on. There isn't a really -- an appropriate quantification of that to give any guidance in general to the market other than to say that it's being received very well. We're going to win our fair share of the business out there and we're seeing a lot of robust activity around it.Thomas J. FallonI will just add that, and we've said, George, that we're not going to comment on the number of trials that we're doing because we think it's a bit of a misleading indicator. I will comment that our pipeline of trials and demos is as big or bigger than it's ever been. So my view is the fact that we've already won 16 customers after basically shipping product for a little over a quarter in this industry is fairly remarkable, and the pipeline of activity is as big or bigger than it's ever been. We are extremely satisfied with the reception of the DTN-X into the market.George C. Notter - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research DivisionAre you limited in terms of the number of trials or account relationships you can maintain right now in the DTN-X? Is there a sales and marketing challenge here?David F. WelchNo, not really. I mean, we're pretty much full, but we're finding the appropriate hours and appropriate scheduling opportunities to make sure we do the right management for the expenses associated with the trials and making sure to qualify that the customers are appropriate. I'd say we're not turning anyone away, but we are definitely operating at a highly efficient operation right now for getting that out.Thomas J. Fallon[indiscernible] if you want to buy one.George C. Notter - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research DivisionLast one I had. Last question I had was on OTN switching. Was that -- is that commercially available right now? Has it been deployed by customers? Can you talk about where you are with that? And also would that provide you with some gross margin lift to the extent that you can deliver that to customers?David F. WelchSure. The DTN-X has a -- comes with it as both the DWDM system based on the super-channel -- 500 gig super-channels, as well as an integrated OTN switch, so all of our systems we deploy have integrated OTN capability. The feature set of that OTN capability is strong right now, and over the series of next few releases over the coming quarters, it will continue to fill out. So to -- the precision to your statement is yes, that's what's shipping out right now as an OTN capability to it, and that's used to make the networks as efficient as possible. The OTN covers a wide range of specifications and you're going to see a continued add on to the specifications over a course of time.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Jeremy David with Morgan Stanley.Jeremy David - Morgan Stanley, Research DivisionI wanted to ask first about the mix that you saw this quarter in terms of 100G revenue versus 10G. And I have a couple of questions on 100G pricing.Ita M. BrennanYes. We're not really going to break out the 10 Gig versus 100 Gig revenue streams. I mean, it -- while significant though, you can see with 8 customers that, that would drive a significant piece of revenue. So it did contribute well to the quarter, but we're not going to kind of try to break those out as separate pieces of business.Jeremy David - Morgan Stanley, Research DivisionOkay. In terms of the pricing environment, how many of those wins have been based on price? Meaning the DTN-X was more competitive than other platforms that were being evaluated? And can you give us a flavor for what pricing is for your solution today versus alternative solutions in the marketplace?David F. WelchYes, I think it's kind of an impossible question to answer quite honestly. We sell networks, we don't sell transponders. We don't sell commoditized items, we sell a fairly -- a highly sophisticated network. Everybody's network is different, everybody's network utilizes a different degree of point-to-point network or different degree of mesh network. And there is no singular pricing around what a network cost in that. So I don't think there's an adequate answer. If I was a component company, which we're not, maybe I could go and I made a commoditized product, maybe I could answer what that is. But as a network company, it doesn't really fit our model.Thomas J. FallonOne comment I'll make, certainly in the market, 100 Gig pricing has come down quite significantly over the past year. We have seen that level off a great deal. I think that, that was necessary. This market, this technology has experienced a price curve that I think is fairly unprecedented in this industry as people are trying to capture market share. I do think that it's leveling off. The second comment I will make is we have not been the lowest-priced offering in each of the ones. We have lost some that we're not the lowest priced and we have won some that we have not the lowest priced, so it's a very competitive market out there. But I think as Dave said, the value proposition of the network, the reputation that we bring or rather quality reliability has value to our customer set.Jeremy David - Morgan Stanley, Research DivisionAnd then just the last one if it would possible. It looks like you have more focus on cash. Other things that you have decided not to pursue in order to get to breakeven faster so, what are those things?Ita M. BrennanNo. I mean, I think it's always been our intention to kind of come back and focus on cash once we got the DTN-X product to market, right? I mean, we, for the last number of quarters, we've been very focused on the need to do that and kind of maybe relax some of our normal kind of operational controls around some things in order to make sure that, that happens. So you'll definitely see us kind of shift back to just normal kind of operational focus around various things. First, it was CapEx; now, it's going to be around inventory, receivables and driving the working capital metrics and ultimately on the P&L as well.Thomas J. FallonI'll add just one flavor to that. I think we've been very clear over the last 2 years that our goal line of success was bringing a world-class product, the DTN-X, to market as soon as humanly possible and we did that. I think we spent the necessary money, we brought the necessary people on board. We created the appropriate technologies to do that. Our next goal line, as Ita mentioned, is consistent cash flow generation. We're going to move the energy of our company toward focusing on that while not forgoing a continuation of delivering great products to customers or customer care.OperatorOur next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham.Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionA couple of questions. First, can you de-crest a little bit and talk about what's going on in the 10 Gig segment of the market in terms of pricing? I think you'd talked about it being extremely competitive and sharply discounting over a prior period. Is that also starting to level out as the market starts to solidify around 40 Gig, 100 Gig Coherent?Thomas J. FallonWell, I think in 10 Gig, 10 gig is experiencing relatively normal price curves. Sometimes in a long technology cycle, the technology cost will flatten out, the price will flatten out. 10 Gig continues to have reasonable price erosion, but partly driven by the fact that our customers are experiencing price erosion in the 10 Gig services they offer so we're seeing, I would say, normal price erosion. I think that talk about 40 Gig, I really do believe 40 Gig has been, we call it a 40 Gig squeeze, we're going to see that. 100 Gig is more cost -- I'm sorry, 100 Gig is more cost-effective than 40 Gig, 10 Gig is more cost effective than 40 Gig. And the market has been waiting for an opportunity to go to a next generation of technology that will afford both the capacity and the dollar per bit that the market needs. It's not 40, it's not going to be 40, it's 100. 10 Gig is still going to have a long life, it's still going to serve a lot of purposes, it's still a good economic answer if you aren't out of capacity. I think that, that 10 Gig is going to last a long time and I think 100 Gig is going to scale magnificently.Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionJust so we're clear, normal pricing curves, that sounds less pressured than what you had been describing in the past, I believe. Am I correct in reading that, that may have started to stabilize -- the rate of decline may have stabilized a little bit as people actually got their 100 Gig products out and Coherent products out so they're no longer scrambling, trying to stem the incursion of the market by dropping 10 Gig? Is that the right way to read it?Thomas J. FallonYes, I think we've been -- I think I'm trying to be clear on 2 things: One, 100 Gig has gone through a rapid price reduction, and we're seeing that stabilize. The other thing I commented on historically is that, until we had 100 Gig solution, we were making economic trade-offs around our 10 Gig solution to allow customers a fair economic solution until we had 100 Gig. So there's a difference between market price of 10 Gig and some of the commercial arrangements we made to make our 10 Gig compelling while people waited for the 100 Gig.Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionSo it has stabilized though?Thomas J. FallonFor us, yes.Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionAnd -- but what about in the broader industry that you're competing -- the backdrop you're competing in? Do you think the pricing of 10 Gig is still coming down hard or do you think it's stabilized?Thomas J. FallonI believe it's stabilized into kind of normal technology curves. I believe that a couple of things are necessary to make a market. One is economics and 2 is in enough viable competitors selling a technology. This year is the first year that there's been a number -- an appropriate number of viable competitors selling 100 Gig solutions.Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionSuper, let me ask a second question if I could. As you're looking at the mix of chassis to line cards, any thought on, given the 16 customers that you've -- now seeing commitments from, how long it will take to start to see a mix shift back to getting some blades into the mix to get the margins up? Is that going to take 12 to 18 months from the time the chassis ship or do you think that it might be longer than that?David F. WelchI'd say that there's 2 dynamics going on, one is there's a relatively short-term transition in order to ramp our manufacturing capabilities, and Ita, you can comment more on that if appropriate. There is a, what we've typically experienced with a customer when they deploy a network as we get a bump and sometimes about 6 months into that, and they start going into more of a full distribution of fill after the initial deployment of -- assuming it's a reasonably large network or so. So I would put it certainly inside of the 12-month period, you see a reasonable distribution of line to fill. These systems have 8 terabits of capacity versus our prior systems which had 1.6 terabits of capacity, so we should see the life of that fill last longer. Certainly from a bandwidth perspective, it lasts subsequently longer. So that those ratios will be more dominant over time going forward.Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionJust if I could follow up on that. So when you're shipping your initial box out at this point, it's going out with what percent loaded?David F. WelchVaries again by customer base, but on a relative basis, it's lightly loaded or certainly, there's a fair amount of growth to go in that system. So multiple hundred gigabits going out in that.Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionDoes it also go out with a similar amount of trip cards in it?David F. WelchIt depends on the customer, depends on the application that you're looking at. The fill of the tribs in general are less than the fill of the line modules. However, in an OTN-enabled network, the line capacity is more fully utilized. It's not a point-to-point network that you're dealing with.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Michael Genovese with MKM Partners.Michael Genovese - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionIn the next quarter's guidance, how do you expect the 10-gigabit DTN business to trend in the fourth quarter?Ita M. BrennanI mean, I think -- although we're not going to break it out just directionally, we are seeing more of our existing larger bandwidth customers transition to the DTN-X, so we will see some falloff on the DTN as the DTN-X ramps, and the DTN-X will ramp for 2 reasons, right? Obviously, there's existing customers moving in and there's new customers adding to the overall revenue number. But we will, for a period of time, we will see kind of the DTN new footprint with these larger bandwidth customers start to decline.Thomas J. FallonWe did add 3 DTN customers this quarter, we added 2 new DTN customers last quarter and then customers who break up their markets by region. Within those customers, we continue to win new regions within the DTN. We have a very large installed base of DTNs. A lot of those are not at capacity. So I certainly agree with Ita's commentary, as far as new business goes, it will be a more guided toward the DTN-X. We anticipate that the DTN-X will then have a good life cycle for a long time.Michael Genovese - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionIta, what I'm trying to get at is the guidance is up $15 million sequentially at the midpoint. So I'm basically trying to ask, do we think that the new product, the DTN-X, is going to be up more than $15 million sequentially in revenues?Ita M. BrennanYes, I mean we're not really going to break that out but we will tell you that the DTN-X is ramping strongly in Q4.Michael Genovese - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionOkay. And then one other question. Going back to the statement. I think -- correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you said that in the third quarter, you shipped 1,000 100G line cards and the whole industry shipped 800 in the second quarter. Can you flesh that out a little bit more? And I know in the 10G, you guys became #1 overnight in terms of line cards, but if you'd ask your competitors, they'd say there's a difference in the system in how they were accounted and you guys were getting a 10:1 kind of advantage on that counting. What's your view on that?Thomas J. FallonWe didn't say it's 1,000 line cards, we said 1,000 100-gig ports. Each one of our line cards has 500 gig on it. And so I know our competitors like to say that, that's not an apples-to-apples. I can tell you that the next 100 gig port that's going to be bought by that customer or fulfilled by the customer is an Infinera port because they pre-provisioned it, it's in place and all they have to do is insert a PM. So whether it's an accurate measure of a point in time, I can't tell you, there's different points of view. I can tell you it's an accurate reflection of market share of 100 gig capacity over time.David F. WelchI will add one other thing in there. George, you need to keep in mind that -- I'm sorry, Mike, that their 100 Gig port is a muxponder, right? They are deploying 100 Gig of bandwidth on line side and they're deploying some amount momentum of 10 gig interfaces into that line card. So the only fair metric and fair comparison is how much line side bandwidth are you shipping for revenue? And then you'll figure out what the fill capability of that is over time. We shipped the equivalent of 1,000 100-gig line side bandwidths for revenue.Operator[Operator Instructions] And our next question does come from Rod Hall with JPMC.Rod B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionJust a couple of quick questions for me. So you mentioned this Tier 1 customer that you're going to announce in Q4. I wonder if you could talk about whether you're going to be the first or second supplier on that customer? I mean, you're going to have the primary position or would you be following someone that's already there? So that's my first question. The second one is just on pricing again, gross margin guidance obviously pretty weak, but yet you're talking about 100 gig pricing declines leveling off. And I just wonder if you can kind of put those 2 things together for us, help us understand. Are we talking about declines leveling off post this quarter we're in now? Or are they already leveled off and other things are driving that gross margin? Can you just talk a little bit about what's going on with the pricing environment, it will be helpful.Thomas J. FallonSo with regard to the customer, until we officially announce that I'm not going to give any clarity on it. I'm going to respect their desire to not talk about it until we can officially talk about it. In regard to costs, Ita, I'm going to ask you to start and then I'll finish.Ita M. BrennanI mean, I think Rod, if you look at the Q4 margin guidance, I mean, what we're really seeing is we have -- with some production ramp issues that are still happening and we clearly have a very strong mix towards new common equipment deployments in that quarter, right? So I don't know that it's necessarily that pricing has gotten any worse from what we were seeing before. It's more just the dynamic of us moving through kind of ramping production on a new product set. We've got that replacing some DTN margin products at the same time, so there's a lot of dynamics there from a gross margin perspective. On top of that, we also have -- we'll have kind of our highest deployment services number in Q4 that we've ever had, and that also carries a slightly lower margin. So when you look at all those things combined, they're really more operational ramp issues than they are anything necessarily related to a change in pricing on a quarter-over-quarter basis.Rod B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionOkay, Ita, could I just -- just following up on that then. If it's mostly mix that's impacting the guidance, could you still -- you have the benefit of seeing more detailed data than we do. So could you just still talk a little bit about what's going on with like-for-like pricing? Is it -- when you say it's leveling off, do you mean it's still coming down a little bit or do you mean it actually is looking pretty flat now quarter-on-quarter?Ita M. BrennanI mean, I think what we saw was if you look back over the last year on 100 Gig, we saw some very aggressive price declines, very competitive. As new vendors moved into the market and now I think it's really reached a point where it can't continue that way and we really are starting to see it level off, right? I don't think it levels off forever, right, and there will be further technology-driven declines out into the future. But I think in this time period, people have kind of reached the point where it really does have to level off so that we can catch up from a cost structure perspective to support the pricing that's been in the market already.Thomas J. FallonWe'll see it kind of level off over the last quarter, so we're pretty much seeing the same type of pricing from a quarter ago. So I do believe as Ita said, the industry is coming to a point where the value proposition of 100 Gig is sufficiently better than 40 Gig. It provides the capacity required for next-generation networks, and people are comfortable with the pricing that is in the market. I will go back and talk about commons again. The most important thing we can do right now is win new footprint and new customers. Commons bear approximately 0% margin. The best thing we can do is ensure that our commons are everywhere so as people fill up, as Dave said, 8 terabits of capacity, it's with Infinera capacity.OperatorAnd I will now turn the meeting back over to Tom Fallon for closing remarks.Thomas J. FallonThank you very much for joining us this afternoon and for your questions. We look forward to staying in touch in the months and quarters ahead with the reports on our continued progress. Have a great day.OperatorThank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.")
# 2012 q4
infn.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rod Hall of "
            "JPMorgan.Joseph Park - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionThis Joe Park calling on behalf of Rod Hall. I just wanted to talk a little bit about your outlook and really dig into DTN-X specifically. It seems like there's a lot of big customer attraction, but it seems like the revenue ramp is going to be delayed -- understanding that the sale cycles are longer. What type of visibility do you have versus what you saw at your Analyst Day regarding your 2013 revenue outlook? And I'd also like to ask you about the gross margin progression. Because even though you're at the high-end of your guidance range this; quarter, it seems like you're sticking with that range. So why exactly do you think that you'll be trending with that current guidance range?Thomas J. FallonSo, this is Tom. You asked a number of questions there. I'm going to poke at the first one first, which was your comment that it appears that the DTN-X revenue ramp is delayed. And I'm just going to disagree with you pretty vehemently. I don't think that the revenue ramp is delayed at all. In 6 months, we've won 22 customers, we've raised our top line, we've achieved #1 market share in 100-gig. I think the ramp has been phenomenal, and quite frankly, it's pretty much right on track with what we said we would do at the Analyst Day in Q4. In regard to visibility, the first quarter of any year in our industry has a little bit of lightness in visibility as new budgets are awarded, and as people make their plans. We still feel comfortable that there will be a reasonable amount of investment in network builds this year. We feel very comfortable that the majority of them are going to be migrating to 100-gig. We believe, very vehemently, that more and more people are going to be looking at making an investment in platforms that not only are 100-gig-ready but are ready for expansion into both converged networks and in terabit capabilities, which is the sweet spot of what the DTN-X was designed for. So I believe that the short-term visibility, in this period of time, is a little challenged. The more macro visibility, we are very comfortable with. We believe, roughly, that industry analysts are correct and that this market should grow roughly 10% this year, and we are staying committed to growing between 10% and 20%, if that's the case. In regard to gross margin, I'll let Ita comment after I do. Our gross margins are -- as we kind of laid out, as we ramp this product, there are a number of gross margin opportunities to improve, as we tried to declare at Analyst Day. First and foremost is just ramping volumes and achieving the yield profile that we think this technology can earn. We are well on that path, but as Ita can explain more thoroughly, we have the cost structure of the PICs that we've made 2 quarters ago, that are hitting our bottom line this quarter, and we need to flush those out. In addition, we need to continue to drive further cost reduction of the PIC technology. Second of all, and this is the phase of our product deployment, and because the deployments are going very well, we are putting in a lot of footprint. That footprint, not only for us but anybody in the industry, is going to have a low margin and that creates the opportunity to fulfill -- or fill that capacity, over time, with higher margin product. So as customers deploy, as customers start generating revenue and then need to expand their capabilities, which will happen starting anywhere from a couple of quarters after initial deployments to longer than that, we'll have the ability to generate substantial margins on that revenue for a long period of time. Ita?Ita M. BrennanYes. I'm not sure there's a whole lot to add to that other than your question about referencing where we are now versus where we were at Analyst Day. I mean, I don't think anything has changed in terms of our outlook. We had cautioned around Q1, just given the typical industry dynamic that we see. And I think that's what we're seeing here, it just takes longer to get ramped up from a bookings perspective in Q1. From a gross margin perspective, I think it's been clear that there was always going to be a ramp improvement in margins and expansion in margins as we went through the year. So I don't think anything has necessarily changed in our view since Analyst Day in December.OperatorOur next question comes from Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley.Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research DivisionQuestion one, the CenturyLink/Qwest deployment. Can you give us a sense as to where we are in that and the pace of that as we look into Q1, and as we look into the rest of the year? And then another question about 100-gig shipments. Are we at a point where we can start counting them and kind of just seeing how much they were up or were they flat in Q4, and kind of what they do, again, in your estimation of Q1?Thomas J. FallonSo, on CenturyLink/Qwest, as we've announced, we have been selected. We have achieved OSMINE certification which was required to expand that capability beyond the original FOA or First Office Application. We have rails that are up and running, and carrying live traffic. And we have a roll out, for the rest of the year, extending that backbone across more and more of their service to markets. So I'm very excited about that opportunity and I think that we've worked with these guys for a very long time. They are a very great customer, while they decide to go in a direction and you execute, you have a lot of opportunity. We also continued to do very well with them in their Metro, both in their regulated and unregulated, with the DTN. So we anticipate our relationship with CenturyLink to continue to blossom and grow over the foreseeable future. In regard to 100-gig, we do break out the ports. We do that for market analysts and we will be doing that, any time now, where the market analysts will report, I think, in the middle of February, what the overall port count was. Port count was up over Q3, but I don't think we are specifically stating what ports, how many we shipped this quarter versus Q3.Ita M. BrennanYes. We're not going to break out the revenue between kind of 10-gig or 100-gig, because that's really not how the business works, right? There are things that you should look at, as we did say we invoiced 7 new DTN-X customers in the quarter. And I think it's fair to say that the DTN-X revenue continues to grow and is becoming more significant from a total revenue perspective.Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research DivisionYes. Back to the question on CenturyLink. Did you recognize revenue in Q4 or is that still unrecognized?Ita M. BrennanYes. We have recognized revenue on the CenturyLink DTN-X deployment.Thomas J. FallonFirst builds.Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research DivisionOkay. And you expect that to ramp pretty much all throughout the year, or do you think it'll be lumpy?Thomas J. FallonI think, in this industry, everything is lumpy. People buy a whole bunch 1 quarter then they tend to deploy it the next quarter, but I think that...Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research DivisionNot necessarily. Initial builds will actually grow over a course of 2, 3, 4 quarters in a row before they hit the lumpy stage. I'm just wondering where we are in that process.Thomas J. FallonWell, we're in the growth phase right now. They continue to award us extensions to the network that we have already built.Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research DivisionSo we're not in the lumpy stage yet, we're still in the growth phase?Thomas J. FallonYou know -- fine. Backward-looking...Ita M. BrennanEhud, to be honest...Thomas J. FallonBackward-looking it's really easy to tell you. Right now, we anticipate they're going to continue purchasing.Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research DivisionAll right. So let me try something else. Pricing in the competitive environment. How are you seeing pricing in 100-gig? You mentioned it's below 40-gig, it's been that way for some time, on a per bit basis. When you look at the competitors you're up against, the Ciena's, the Alcatel-Lucent's, the Huawei's, how have you seen the pricing environment? Have people kind of taken their foot off the gas pedal in terms of declining pricing or are they still aggressive? I mean, obviously they are still aggressive, but have you seen it take another step down?Thomas J. FallonYes, it's -- I'll, I guess, answer it in a couple of ways. One, the first way, which is if you're looking at a transponder-based comparison, prices came down radically year-over-year, as people were interested in making sure that market share was preserved, particularly, I think, as we came to market. They were interested in not letting us have a foothold. I think that the pricing, on a transponder basis, has gone to more normal levels now. So I don't think we're going to continue to see the dramatic reductions that the last year had. And I also think customers are more and more interested in the cost of converged networks versus alternative architectures. And when you bake that into it, it becomes more of a network cost versus a transponder cost discussion. And I think that discussion is going to take more and more meaning every year moving forward.Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research DivisionOkay. One last thing. EMEA was pretty strong this quarter. Anything in particular we should read into that, with the one customer issue, was that a...Ita M. BrennanYes. I mean, I think it's just more that as customers start to deploy DTN-X, we start to see -- we'll see some lumpiness around the geographical split, but we are seeing a lot of interest in the DTN-X and the 100-gig in Europe.Thomas J. FallonEurope has a number of customers who have deployed and are in the process of making a DTN-X decision. So we're seeing fairly robust activity on new builds. I guess, the backdrop, as you know, of a European financial challenge. And I would say more metered fill coming out of Europe, but reasonable amount of new build activity, in both Eastern and Western Europe.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Subu Subrahmanyan with JudaGroup.Natarajan Subrahmanyan - TheJudaGroup, Research DivisionCould you talk, maybe, about profitability? Kind of what the model looks like as you get to breakeven and if you anticipate that happening in any given quarter in 2013.Ita M. BrennanYes. So I think if we go back to what we talked about on Analyst Day, just in terms of 2013 first, we've talked about getting to a cash flow breakeven point in the second half of 2013, right? And obviously, we've put a revenue range out there that's in the 10% to 20% growth range. So you can envisage a ramping revenue line and some margin expansion as we go through the year, to stay in that 38% to 40% gross margin rate for the year, right? Beyond that, we've talked about margin expansion to 45% at the gross margin level, right? And I think that becomes a combination of us leveraging the PICs and the modules plants and the factories that we have. But also starting to see the benefits from the PICs, from the network footprint that we're putting in now. And I mean we are making heavy new footprint deployments right now. We shipped more amplifiers in Q4 than we have since way back in the beginning of 2009, right? We're definitely investing right now in footprint, and you will start to see margin expand out of that as we go through the year, and then onwards beyond that.Natarajan Subrahmanyan - TheJudaGroup, Research DivisionUnderstood. And cash flow breakeven, it'll be operating breakeven as well in the second half of '13?Ita M. BrennanYes. I mean, right now, for sure, we say you'd start to hit the cash flow breakeven point. And when it kind of turns to P&L break-even, whether that's kind of in the second half or a little bit later, it's hard to tell yet, right? Our kind of guidance, right now, has been around saying we would hit a consistent cash flow breakeven by the second half.Natarajan Subrahmanyan - TheJudaGroup, Research DivisionUnderstood. On pricing, Tom, the question was around 10-gig. I mean, how does 100-gig compare to 10-gig, in terms of pricing right now? For the top carriers. I know it is less expensive than 40, but on a per bit basis versus 10.Thomas J. FallonI'm going to ask Dave. Dave, you want to answer that?David F. WelchYes. I think the -- I understand that 10-gig and 100-gig are slowly migrating to where they're applying to different applications. I mean, it's not really a head-to-head number of 10-gig to 100-gig. You've got more 10-gig in the metro area and lower capacity issues in the long-haul -- with long-haul routes, 10- to 100-gig is probably on par to a little bit below that, of 10-gig, on an application, application. In lots of applications where you don't need the capacity of the 100-gig or you don't need the better granularity, on a wavelength basis 10-gig is more competitive. So it's not quite a fair comparison to have between the 2.Natarajan Subrahmanyan - TheJudaGroup, Research DivisionFair enough. For a carrier that has 10-gig in the backbone today, though, it's sounded like -- if they replace it with 100-gig, it's less expensive on a per-gig basis than 10-gig. Did I understand that right, Dave?David F. WelchFor incremental business, if I have a 10-gig previously deployed network, it will be less expensive to incrementally put more 10-gigs on that network than it will be to upgrade the system and all the commons that are required of that to 100-gig. If I'm planning a network that I have an incremental build of multiple 100-gigs of bandwidth that I need to put on a network, then I will likely pay that commons expense to install a 100-gig so I can get on a better dollar-per-gigabit train. But there's an entry price to that.Natarajan Subrahmanyan - TheJudaGroup, Research DivisionRight. Yes, I meant transponder to transponder, really, comparison.Thomas J. FallonCertainly, from an operating cost, 100-gig for a core backbone, is substantially less power, space, ease-of-use, provisioning. The CapEx is probably, as Dave said, roughly on par. From an operating expense it's substantially less. There's nobody that's going to, in my mind, build a 10-gig core network at this point, that has any substantial volume. It's just not practical.David F. WelchBut they will add 10-gigs to their...Thomas J. FallonThey will add 10-gig.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Michael Genovese, MKM Partners.Michael Genovese - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionIta, I believe that you said during the prepared remarks that you shipped 1,000 10-gig ports during the fourth quarter. I just want to verify that you said that. And based on that number, all of you, do you think that you are #1 on that metric in the fourth quarter? It looks like you might be. And could you just speak, kind of qualitatively, about the competitors? Ciena, Alcatel, Huawei. Anybody you're seeing more than anyone else? Anyone whose technology looks better? Anyone acting differently than others on pricing? And then I have a second question later.Ita M. BrennanYes, so I think it was over 1,000 100-gig ports, right? Obviously we think that's a very compelling shipment number. Whether it puts us in #1 market share or not, we'll have to wait and see when the market share data comes out. But we do think that's a pretty compelling metric. In terms of the competitive landscape, I'd ask Tom maybe to chime in on that a little bit.Thomas J. FallonSo it's a competitive environment. The people that we primarily see continue to be Ciena, very spread across almost all areas. And certainly, in certain areas, we see a lot of Alcatel. Alcatel continues to be aggressive on pricing, which continues to perplex me. We see less and less Huawei and that's, I would say, a statement that applies in both North America and in Europe.Michael Genovese - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionGreat. That's a very helpful answer. And then, second question. Here in the fourth quarter, and with the first quarter guidance, I mean, very solid performance. But this is actually a time when your comps, suppliers, different people on the value chain have been seeing some weakness, I think, particularly in December and the March quarter. Everybody's hoping CapEx -- or confident CapEx will ramp in the second quarter in the back half. But you've done well in this period of CapEx weakness. What are your expectations for CapEx in the second quarter and the second half and is that a part of the story here? Do you think that it's just the 100-g product cycle or is this the 100-g product cycle plus better CapEx?Thomas J. FallonI think that my view is that when people have CapEx discussions, what they're vastly talking about is what is Verizon and AT&T going to buy. And I think that looks at the world too narrowly. And if you look over the history of time, more and more flows of traffic on the Internet are moving to alternatives besides that. Those alternatives, be they wholesalers, be they Internet content people, be they cable people, have been the core of Infinera's business. And we see, both with our core, but also new opportunities of tier 1s domestically and international, we see an environment where there are more plans to build more networks at this time of the year than we have seen in the last couple of years. So I think part of it certainly is a 100-gig migration to the optical reboot of 100-gig. Part of it is people trying to make a more intelligent transport layer by putting some of the intelligence of historically routing and switching layers into the optical layer. Because it can be done more cost effectively. And part of it is, there is a lot of just fundamental demand for increased high-capacity capability. I think we are seeing a reasonable amount of that. But that's different than the discussion of AT&T and Verizon are having bigger CapEx plans. And it's very easy to, I think, use those synonymously with the industry, and I don't believe they're synonymous anymore.Michael Genovese - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionThat's another great answer. So do you not necessarily then have a view on the second half of the year and whether CapEx will be 20% higher in the second half of the year, this year, or not? It sounds like it's almost irrelevant to your trajectory. But just for the heck of it, do have a view there?Thomas J. FallonYes, I don't really have a view that would be unique or have any insight into that other than what I hear from the same people you hear it from: Analysts and suppliers.OperatorOur next question comes from Sanjiv Wadhwani with Stifel, Nicolaus.Sanjiv R. Wadhwani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research DivisionTom, I just wanted to get a gauge. When you look at the RFPs and RFIs that are out there, would you be able to characterize as to sort of what percentage of them are on the 100-gig side?Thomas J. FallonI'll have Dave answer that question.David F. WelchYes. We see a bunch of RFIs, RFPs in the long-haul space. And understand that these are questions, not necessarily decision points, but I'd say probably about 70% of the RFIs and RFPs, that we have out there, ask the question of 100-gig capability. They also, we're seeing, actually, a substantive takeup of -- 75% of the RFPs are asking for integrated OTN switching with that, and that plays right into our strengths for them.Sanjiv R. Wadhwani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research DivisionSo, I guess, within that context -- and it's a broad-level question, when you look at the product revenue increase in December versus September, it is about $10 million. I'm guessing the DTN-X sort of probably did north of that $10 million. I'm just trying to get a gauge. I know you don't want to break out, specifically, on the DTN-X. But in 2013, should we be looking at DTN-X accounting for half of your shipments or revenues, or any metrics that you can broadly talk about?Ita M. BrennanYes. I mean, Sanjiv, I don't think we're going to break that out. And to be honest, it's not really a relevant metric. Once we're steady-state with the DTN-X, and we can provide the network infrastructure, either a 10, DTN or DTN-X, it doesn't really matter. So we're selling networks and we're selling both products into the same customers, right? So I'm not sure, we're probably not going to break that out, just from an accounting perspective, and I'm not sure it's really a helpful metric. I mean, we have tried to provide some metrics around the numbers of customers that are invoicing and so on, so you can see us invoice another 7 DTN-X customers this quarter. So, clearly, it's ramping and it is becoming a significant part of the overall revenue number.Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionOkay. But just on a clarification point of view, is it fair to assume that the $10 million increase that you saw in product revenues, from Q3 to Q4, the DTN-X did higher than that?Ita M. BrennanYes. I mean, clearly, we've said a lot of the new higher capacity, new network deployments are going would DTN-X. So that should say that it's higher than that, right?OperatorAnd our next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionI just wanted to ask some questions about your Instant Bandwidth program. I think you now have a couple of customers on that, including TeliaSonera and KDDI. How does that impact revenues and margins relative to your traditional sales model? And also, what kind of customer do you think would be more attracted to using this kind of sales model versus the traditional one?Ita M. BrennanYes. I mean, I think the Instant Bandwidth, for us, is an added tool to the toolbox in terms of how we sell and how we approach customers. It allows us to, for a particular customer type, where they really want to match their spending with revenue, it allows us to kind of more closely align ourselves with their business, right? What we see is that lots of customers want to come in and buy the 500-gig capacity upfront, but we'll also see some customers where this model is a better fit to their needs and what they want. So we see it as a competitive tool in certain circumstances, but we still see a lot of customers wanting to actually go and purchase the capacity upfront.Thomas J. FallonI think Ita provided the right context. We're providing a choice to customers. We have no bias one way or the other. And the opportunity for us is to be on the same side of the table as our customers. So as they're trying to win business, we can put them in the best spot to do that today and tomorrow. And I think that we give them a choice, the people who want to use 500-gig today, and there's several of those, we have that choice. People who want to pay for 100-gig today because they're uncertain about tomorrow. They know they're going to grow, they're not sure when. We give them that choice. We're on the same side of the table as our customer and none of our competitors can offer this.Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionJust to be clear. So $1 of revenue that is booked as Instant Bandwidth, does that have the same margin profile as if it had been sold as a 500-gig increment?David F. WelchI think the network margin -- what Instant Bandwidth allows us to do is, one, win more deals and take greater market share because it's an added tool; two, it impacts -- or positively impacts our overall margin portfolio profile.Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionAnd that positive impact is over the life of the sale or is it in that initial 100-gig increment?David F. WelchIt's over the medium-range. Relatively short amount of time for it to play catch-up and surpass. It's a value to the customer. The customers can turn on a circuit instantaneously in a day as opposed to a 40-day process that might exist in an alternative mechanism. That value, we get credit for it.Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionOkay. And then just separate question. You commented on 100-gig price pressure normalizing now or subsiding. What about 10-gig? How are pricing trends evolving in that part of the market?David F. WelchThey're pretty stable. Stable in the realm of standard yearly reductions that go on within the industry. Again, you have to look at it -- 10-gig is being utilized on a brownfield fill, and in the long-haul, if there's not a lot of greenfield long-haul, there is some for 10-gig, and then there's a lot of lower capacity, different application metrics where 10-gig plays a role.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham and Company.Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionFirst off, congratulations on the really nice customer win rate. I was hoping you could give us a little bit more clarity on the 22-customer piece. What portion of those 22 were existing customers and what portion were new customers? Is that 7 DTN-X new customers that you were invoiced all new customers, or are those the only new customers there that are in the 22? I would assume they're not.Ita M. BrennanYes. So out of the 22 purchase commitments, we said there are 7 that are new, right? If you look at kind of what's been invoiced versus that, we've probably invoiced a little over half of those 7 new customers at this point, right?Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionOkay. And can you help me out a little bit on the guidance for 1Q, on the mix between product and service? Obvious your service jumped up quite a bit in the December quarter. You've probably made comments about this earlier, I missed the first 10 or 15 minutes of the call. So will that come down back to a similar level to the mix that you had in the first half of 2012 or will it -- is that driven by the installation rates which, therefore, will keep it higher and, therefore, higher as a percentage of the overall revenues?Ita M. BrennanYes. I mean, I think we would expect it to come down off of Q4, but probably not back to the levels that we saw earlier in 2012 or even at the end of last year, right? So we have enough -- the volatility has been driven by the amount of deployments, and the level of deployment activity that we're doing. So Q1 will still have a very healthy deployment -- amount of deployments going on. So it won't be as high as Q4, but it'll probably be higher than what you had seen historically for a while.Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionOkay. One last question, and I'll try to keep a little short here. The mix of customers that you're seeing, as we're going into the first half of 2013, between customers that were existing customers driving revenue and customers that you're seeing with extended period of acceptance criteria associated with new builds. Can you talk a little bit about what the mix is between those in terms of dollar value of revenues ordered? Is there a fair amount of pent-up revenue that is waiting for accrual of that acceptance criteria?Ita M. BrennanI think, you'll see this in the 10-K when we file it, but our backlog, and that includes kind of our financial backlog, is pretty much flat to where it was at the end of last year, right? So it's not that there is a tremendous backlog of stuff kind of on the books coming into Q1. That's why the visibility in Q1 is important, right? What we do see, though, is that -- I think the comment about the linearity as the cause of the acceptance, it's pushing some of our revenue to the back end of the quarter. And it's taken longer to kind of process that revenue in a quarter, right? But it's not that we're coming in with a huge backlog kind of into Q1.Thomas J. FallonEven customers who we've had a relationship for a longtime, when they buy a new platform like the DTN-X, some of them want to do acceptance on the first network build. Not all of them, but some of them. So it's important that we don't parse too fine around new customer versus old customer because sometimes a new DTN-X customer who is an old customer will have the same acceptance criteria. I think one of the things that you should look at, as Ita pointed out, our backlog is roughly where it was on growing bookings. That's a very significant sign, and I mentioned it in my commentary. The DTN-X networks that we're deploying, not only are we ramped and are shipping aggressively, but the turnups are going very well. I think that you will find, and if go talk to customers, when they're deploying our networks it's not taking them a long time to turn them from a PO into a revenue collecting network for them, and that means the acceptance is happening as planned. And I think on a new technology, sometimes that's a risk or a challenge. The DTN-X is leveraging the lessons learned on the DTN, and it is continued to be easy to buy, easy to deploy, easy to turn up and easy to start collecting revenue on.Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionAt the risk of being a liar, I'm going to ask one more question, because you spurred a question. Can you give us some sense of what the percent fill is on the boxes that are being shipped out? I mean, are you shipping 25% loaded, 30% loaded, 35%? What kind of ratio?David F. WelchPeople typically deploy things relatively lightly-loaded. And these are 5 terabit boxes. They're not going out with 5 terabits of bandwidth, they're going with something less than thatAlexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division25% a reasonable guess?Ita M. BrennanWe're not going to go there.OperatorAnd we do have time for one final question. And that question comes from George Notter with Jefferies.George C. Notter - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research DivisionI guess I wanted to ask about -- Tom, I'd love your perspective on the disclosure from Alcatel-Lucent around the time of their financing, they said their terrestrial optical gross margins were around 17%. And I guess I bring the question up because you guys are trying to drive a margin expansion story here. Here is a competitor that feels like, based on the gross margin, really being aggressive on pricing. I mean, do you think that's a real inhibitor to your ability to expand margins over time or do you kind of look through that? What's your perspective?Thomas J. FallonI think my perspective is a couple fold. One, we do see them being aggressive in the market. And we were never sure what allowed them to do that. When they had to publicly disclose their margins, it became clear that they were doing it not because a cost structure advantage, but because -- I assume, because they desperately need to hold and grow their market position to allow time for them as a company to right their ship. I think that the 17 points they articulated has -- is probably lower than reality of true cost of goods. I assume that, as a company like Alcatel, there's a fairly significant corporate overhead that they have to pay to the mother ship. I don't know what that percentage would be, but I assume it's nontrivial. But even if you add 5 to 10 points, you're still talking mid-20s from a gross margin perspective. And that tells me a couple of things: one, they have a cost structure disadvantage, not a cost structure advantage; second of all, when we compete head-to-head with them, we are winning a reasonable amount of business and we -- candidly, customers who use both, they say our experience is significantly better. So sometimes you can lower price when you're trying to buy market share, sometimes you'd lower price if you have a product that is, in certain characteristics, inferior. Sometimes you have to lower price to get rid of the risk premium if Alcatel goes away. I don't know what is their thinking process, but I feel pretty comfortable that they cannot continue to be price leaders and cost laggards over the intermediate term. And we are going to continue to develop cutting-edge technology. We are going to continue to deploy networks that carry live traffic quickly. We're going to continue to work very hard to delight our customers. And I think that combination is going to be pretty hard to beat.George C. Notter - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research DivisionOne last one. NSN recently, sold their optical business to a private equity firm. Are you guys seeing any impact from that in the marketplace? Is that dislocating customers or creating RFP or RFI activity? Any impact there would be interesting to hear about.Thomas J. FallonIn my observation, George, it would be it's probably too soon to see an impact from that event. We are seeing an impact from the events with NSN over the last year, where companies became suspicious of the commitment to staying in the optical space. We've recently won a couple of deals that's displacing old NSN optical gear. But that's not triggered by the recent sale, that was triggered a while back by the concerns of NSN not being committed to optical. I do think that, that shoe was going to drop, still. I think that the acquisition, I think, reaffirms that the industry is going to change and consolidate, because the structure of the industry, today, probably isn't viable. I think that -- I don't know, Marlon [ph], but I certainly respect their courage of attacking this industry with a company like NSN who has good footprint, but to the best of my knowledge, has no differentiating technology. And I think they're going to have -- they got a mouthful to swallow, that's all I know.Thomas J. FallonThank you, all, for joining us this afternoon, and for your questions. We look forward to staying in touch in the months and quarters ahead, with reports on our continued progress. Have a great day.OperatorAnd that concludes conference. Thank you very much for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.")
# 2013 q1
infn.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from George Notter"
            " with Jefferies.George C. Notter - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research DivisionI guess I wanted to ask about the DTN-X, and it feels like the pace at which you guys are adding customers and seeing revenue growth maybe is a bit ahead of where you guys have previously expected. And I guess I'm just trying to understand what's new here. Is this the addition of certain particular customers that could be sizable? Is it more broad-based? I mean, is there any kind of root cause analysis you guys can point us towards to talk about sort of the inflection in this DTN-X business?Thomas J. FallonGeorge, it's Tom. First of all, thanks for the congratulations. Second of all, certainly, the DTN-X progress is at the upper end of what we were driving for. We're a pretty aggressive group of people, so we're trying to, quite frankly, win as many opportunities as possible. But from a more balanced perspective, I would say we are winning customers at a clip that is, to me, very impressive. And the size of the deals is also impressive, both from an initial footprint and opportunity over time. I think that where I am looking at, where we're being pleasantly not surprised, but on the upside, Europe has really been a great place for us while most of the world talks still about the challenges of Europe and there are many. They are clearly a significant number of networks being built in Eastern and Western Europe. And I think that we are benefiting a great deal from that. Our outlook for the future, I think, has been enhanced with more comfort toward the top end of the range because the DTN-X is being very well received by potential Asia customers. We won't win all of them, but the interest is very significant and I'm confident that we're going to win at least some of them. And in our home base, where we've kind of always had an established leadership role, cable, Internet content providers...David F. WelchWholesale.Thomas J. FallonWholesalers, they're putting in networks. Capacity is certainly -- requirements are certainly growing. It is clear to me that anybody building a new network today is going to build with 100-gig. I feel very comfortable that we have the best 100-gig solution on the market. Our reputation for quality, time as a weapon and customer support is unparalleled. So I just think we're seeing an investment period after a dearth of investment. I'm seeing 100-gig being standardized as the right answer for today and tomorrow, and Infinera is just executing well.George C. Notter - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research DivisionDo you think, just expanding on that, do you think there's anything that's more germane to the marketplace itself that's going on? Would it be just the pure economics of 100 gig? As they improve, do you think people will start to come off the sidelines and launch more RFPs and more deals and deployments? Do you think it's maybe the presence of more vendors in the marketplace that's getting people off the sidelines? Could be the presence of Infinera, certainly, that was previously in overhang in the 100-gig space? And now that overhang has come off as you guys issue product, I mean, it seems like there's just more activity out there right now, and I guess I'm trying to understand why that is, above and beyond just you guys now having a product.Thomas J. FallonI think it's all those things, George. I think that, even as recently a year ago, there was a grand debate on when it was going to be 40-gig for how long and then 100, or is it going to go to 100? The 100-gig supply base was too narrow to be standardized upon. 100-gig pricing did not offer a compelling economic choice to 10-gig. I do believe, just like we did with 10-gig, Infinera entered the market in catalyzed rapid growth. Other people have also entered the market. I think that the customer base today use 100-gig as the best economic choice and a broad enough supply base that there's a lot of great deal of risk. I also think that just like we've said for a long time, a 40-gig squeeze is happening and nobody is going to be wrestling whether it's going to be 40 or is it going to be 100. It's 100, it's today. It's 500, it's today. And we have a great platform, a great install base and there is a pent-up demand for transmission capacity around the world.George C. Notter - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research DivisionGot it. Great. And then one just last qualification. You guys threw out a couple of numbers earlier I missed. 335 terabits and then I think you compared that with 180 terabits in the prior quarter. Was that be amount of 500-gig super channel add in aggregate each quarter, Q1 versus Q4?Thomas J. FallonNo, it's the cumulative amount, let me go look at the numbers real quick. It's the cumulative amount of basically we sell it ALOM. As people buy the whole thing, it's got 500-gig on it. If people buy bandwidth by channel, if we have one channel that accounts for that, we're collectively adding up all of the capacity that is cumulatively deployed in the world.David F. WelchAnd there's a slight difference between bandwidth product purchased and product deployed, so this represents the amount that's going through the acceptance in the deployment cycles.Thomas J. FallonAnd it's 335 versus 180, George. And obviously, that number should grow every quarter. Don't view it as an incremental -- that 335 as incremental. It's the cumulative amount of capacity.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Rod Hall with JPMC.Ashwin Kesireddy - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionThis is Ashwin on behalf of Rod. Tom, could you elaborate on the 100-gig pricing comment that you made? I think you said that your 100-gig price is probably flattening versus the industry. Does that mean that you are seeing less pricing pressure? And is it specific to Infinera or is it a market-wide phenomenon? Can you elaborate on that?Thomas J. FallonWell, I specifically said it's no longer falling at the rate it has fallen at the last 2 years and is now approaching more traditional industry norms. Usually, when you introduce a new technology, it takes a number of years, typically greater than 5, before that technology will offer price per bit parity. And with 100-gig, that's been about 2 years and it's already much more cost-effective than 40-gig at a price per bit, and it's actually, quite frankly at this point, less than 10 on a price per bit basis. That's a very rapid degradation of pricing. That's good in one way. It helps the market adopt that technology as a standard and ramps that volume in the industry much more rapidly. As a vertically integrated manufacturer, we have more benefit from that ramp than the traditional competitors do because the more volume we create, the lower price or cost of each device. We are not trying to drive that price curve. The market drives the price curve as people enter the market and are interested in establishing footprint. There's several of us in the market now, and any -- on any given day, some customer might be viewed as strategically important, one of the competitors, and for that, it drives a market price down. The market will typically respond, the competitors will typically respond. We've seen that behavior over the last year. What we're seeing now is less of that behavior. There's a kind of a market price that's been set. And within a small range around that, that doesn't mean that for some strategic customer, somebody won't do something what I would consider out of common sense practice that's part of the business world. But I do see that the natural degradation of pricing is going to be slower. I think that's very important because our industry needed to have the opportunity to recoup our R&D through fair margins and that's a challenge in our industry. As you can see, as Ita pointed out, we believe that our margins are starting to uptick, so we believe that we're taking advantage of the volume that we are creating in the market and that should help us over the next several quarters or several years.Ashwin Kesireddy - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionFair enough. Shifting gears to the general business environment. I mean, obviously, we saw a lot of negative news around CapEx in the last few weeks. How do you characterize the business environment out there in the market now?Thomas J. FallonSo I'm going to put some fidelity on what I'm hearing you say. Negative news on CapEx over the last few weeks, what it specifically is, is negative news on CapEx from a couple of Tier 1s, not negative news in general in the market. Is that correct assertion or incorrect assertion?Ashwin Kesireddy - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionYes, maybe you can start there.Thomas J. FallonSo I continue to be somewhat befuddled by what I consider a fairly narrow view of the world of CapEx as being defined by a couple of Tier 1s in North America. We're growing business, obviously, not with the people who are publicly saying their CapEx is going down. We're picking up market share. We see incredible opportunities with cable, with wholesalers, with international Tier 1s, with content providers. And as long as the industry views 1 or 2 people as defining the market, I think there's going to be a disjoint of reality of who's going to do well and who's not going to do well. Our job as a company is to get into those markets because they are important markets, but I do not believe they define the market.OperatorOur next question comes from Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley.Kimberly A. Watkins - Morgan Stanley, Research DivisionThis is Kim Watkins in for Ehud today. Just wanted to first ask you about your large Tier 1 in North America -- or actually the U.S. It looked like, just looking at the revenue trends for domestic versus international, that they are relatively similar or so. Just want to get a sense of when you're expected to see a ramp from CenturyLink specifically? How you expect that deployment to occur? Does it happen in one quarter suddenly? Are we going to be surprised to see the domestic number tick up pretty significantly? Just your expectations there would be helpful.Ita M. BrennanYes, I mean, I think it's hard to derive that from looking at the split, geographical split. I mean, we are seeing a lot of strength internationally and a lot of kind of the new customers that we had have actually been international customers. So that's going to mask what you will see as shifting revenues in North America. I would point you to our top 5 customers and the fact that there's a Tier 1 customer in there. And that's a major Tier 1 customer, an important customer to us. I'm not sure that we can say very much else about CenturyLink at this point, but that is -- we are seeing that growth in that Tier 1 customer being in the top 5.Kimberly A. Watkins - Morgan Stanley, Research DivisionGot it. Okay. That's helpful. And then the comment about -- Tom, you made a comment about some opportunities in Asia. Could you just comment on the number of 100-gig RFPs right now in China, specifically? Are you involved in any of those? And if so, would that result in any additional margin pressure, i.e. this flattening in pricing that you're seeing at a global basis? Is there any differences on a regional basis?Thomas J. FallonYou're -- yes, I -- you're going to put me on a little bit of a soap box for a second and I apologize. I see all of the news about the big builds and 100-gig coming in China. And you'll notice that they're all Huawei and ZTE-oriented. I want -- my view and it's a biased view, the China market is not an open market to non-Chinese supplier for long-haul transmission. We are involved with 0 RFPs. We have, I believe, 0 opportunity to win any RFPs. It is a closed market. What we're seeing opportunities around the world, we're seeing them in Japan; we're seeing them in Hong Kong; we're seeing the New Zealand, Australia area; we're seeing them in India; we see them -- we're seeing them in Korea. We're seeing broad-based ranges of opportunity -- Vietnam. Whether we win those, I'm not -- I don't know. But DTN-X is viewed as cutting-edge technology with a history of large-scale deployments around the world with other carriers. And we are being invited very aggressively to both RFPs and our earning opportunities for shortlisting. I think that the tale will still be told later this year. But we have not seen this amount of broad activity in Asia ever, and I'm expectant of success in that area, though starting off at a pretty small base.Kimberly A. Watkins - Morgan Stanley, Research DivisionGot it. Just to my question, specifically, about pricing, the comment about pricing relative to is it turning back to industry norms, which I think is somewhere around 10% to 15% declines per year. Is it -- are there any differences on a regional basis that you're seeing?Thomas J. FallonIt's -- I would say it's fairly the same around the world. There are some areas in the world that have historically seen -- shocking areas, better pricing. Some of it sometimes is due, what I would consider, to nationalistic pride of, if there's a supplier in that region, they typically will make sure they are the provider of choice by the telecom company in that region and they'll get unusual price. But in general, the pricing and the pricing expectations are relatively the same. The biggest difference in pricing will come from how big is the opportunity. Obviously, the guy buying $10 million or $15 million a year is probably going to get a better price and they are buying $1 million a year.Kimberly A. Watkins - Morgan Stanley, Research DivisionYes, got it. One last question. Just wanted to explore the service gross margin line. I realize it's been a little bit weaker because of the deployment mix in the services line. Ita, how are you thinking about the service margin, specifically, shaking out throughout the year? And I guess, related to that, I guess we need to talk about revenues because it seems like you've got quite a lot of activities so I would expect deployment revenues to be -- continue to be strong, but just wanted to hear your thoughts there.Ita M. BrennanYes, I mean, I think we expect to see the deployment revenues stay strong, and that kind of high 50%, 60% gross margin is probably a good place to think about services margins being for the rest of the year because we will -- we're doing a lot of deployments. We're doing some deployments in new regions, et cetera, so we will see increased activity and some of the new activity, which we'll need to optimize over time. So I think kind of high 50%, 60% is a good place to be.OperatorOur next question comes from Mike Genovese with MKM Partners.Michael Genovese - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionBut speaking of the guide, did you think about not necessarily tightening the range but lowering the bottom end, or even just raising the entire guide? It seems like the second half would have to be pretty terrible for you to come in the lower end of this 10% to 20% for this year.Ita M. BrennanYes, and I think based on my comments, we're saying we're pretty comfortable with the upper end of the range at this point. If you think about the back end of the year, I mean, our visibility has improved, but we still don't have visibility at a bottoms up basis to the second half even though we think there's good momentum there and there's a lot of RFP activity there. So I think our message is more that we're comfortable with the upper end of that range at this point. And then as we get more visibility on the next call, we'll provide some more fidelity through the end of the year.Thomas J. FallonThe other thing to avoid, Mike, is getting into the habit of kind of giving a year outlook on every quarterly. We gave the original year outlook, if you remember, in Investor Day, and what we're trying to do is update our view of that guidance at that time versus reset guidance on quarterly calls that extend beyond a quarter.Michael Genovese - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionGreat. So along those lines, with the order strength, could just give us a sense of the backlog expansion? I mean, is there any just goal post you can put around? How much bigger the backlog is now than it was at the end of 2012?Ita M. BrennanYes, we're not going to give kind of quarterly backlog numbers, we put in the K once a year and that we're probably going to stick to that. But it's up a significant amount, right? I mean, it certainly helps us have comfort around the guide for Q2.Michael Genovese - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionOkay. And just your advantage on kind of order to time to build a network to time to taking revenue, could you just give us again -- I mean, versus the competition, the typical competitors you have out there, how much faster do you think you're turning orders into revenues than they are?Ita M. BrennanI think from a pure rev-rec perspective, it's going to vary significantly customer by customer. From a network turnup perspective, I think we believe we do that significantly faster than the competition.Thomas J. FallonI know for a fact in Q1, we won a deal when one of our competitors could not execute the requested timeline. And I think that, quite frankly, we were going to #2 on the deal. We ended up winning it. Now that network was taken in the quarter, it was delivered in the quarter, it was turned up in the quarter, it was turned over in the quarter. I think our culture, our DNA of time as a weapon, our architecture as a digital architecture, you can display services and equipment very quickly. And that, I think, is a big advantage to some customers some of the time. What other competitors do, I don't really know. Our customers just say, If I need it fast, I know I need to get it from Infinera.Michael Genovese - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionOkay. Just, hopefully, a couple more quick ones. The seasonality, Tom, I mean, now that your customer base is broadening out more, do you think that seasonality is a factor? And that now that we're past 1Q, which is the -- should be the seasonally weakest quarter of the year, do you have any view on industry seasonality? And I realized that we're not talking about just AT&T and Verizon. We're not really talking about them, we're talking about everybody else. But do you have kind of an updated view on seasonality now that the customer count is up to well over 20, approaching 30, for DTN-X?Thomas J. FallonYes, there's still an impact of seasonality. Depending on which industry there is, certain industries buy more in the first half of the year, certain industries buy more in the second half of the year. I think as we expand our customer base beyond 27 into more and more both geographies and industries, it'll become more moderated, but I would not assume at this point that we're going to escape seasonality. Clearly, in Q1, which is typically a very tough quarter for both the industry and us, we came through pretty well. But I think that the industry would still say that Q1 had some seasonality. And I think Q1 will continue to be a slower quarter for our industry in general, and I don't think that we're going to be immune from that moving forward.Michael Genovese - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionOkay. Then finally, Ita, you mentioned the midterm margin target. I think you said on the gross margin, 45%, but still I think there's a long-term target out there at 50%, unless I'm wrong about that?Ita M. BrennanYes, I mean, we pretty much reset to the midterm view the Analyst Day and we haven't really updated our long-term model beyond that. I think we're more focused on achieving that 45% and then providing some further color after that.Michael Genovese - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionIs the 45% -- is that with the 10% operating margin, am I remembering that correctly?Ita M. BrennanCorrect.Operator[Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Alex Henderson with Needham.Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionI was hoping you could talk a little bit about the mix between existing customers and the new customers in terms of not just simply the number of orders but rather what degree the existing customers are already showing up -- or excuse me, the new customers are showing up as revenue? Or are the larger new customers still longer time to deploy in revenue recognition? The -- looking at the orders that you've had announced on your website and tracking them against existing customers, with the exception of KDDI and 2 small customers, virtually all of the announced contracts on the website for the last 2 quarters were existing customers and I'm assuming that there are a couple larger orders underneath the surface from new customers that are going to take a little longer to come through. So can you give us, in terms of magnitude, of what you're seeing in terms of new customers in the current quarter and what we should expect that to go towards as the year progresses?Ita M. BrennanYes, I mean, I think if you look at the number of new customers that we've invoiced, right, I mean, there's a good percentage of those that are new customers, and new customers are all driving significant revenue amount because you can't -- you're not going to turn up a DTN-X network with an acceptance, et cetera, without driving meaningful dollars, right? So I think every new DTN-X customer that we've talked about or those that we can't talk about are driving meaningful revenue and have potential to drive further revenue. But a DTN-X initial deployment is still multimillion dollar of revenue at any point in time.Thomas J. FallonI also think it's important not to focus just on the names we announced. As Ita said, there are a number of very significant wins we both had and recognize revenue on from very significant market segments that are -- they just don't allow you to talk about it. And that's the Internet content space. It's the Tier 1 space. It's the cable space. So be cautious of assuming that if we announce somebody that you think doesn't drive a lot of revenue, that that's representative of the entire suite of customers we are winning and delivering for revenue on DTN-X.Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionNo, just trying to get a handle on the pig in the python problem with a lot of your first half '12 customers deferring into the back half and it looks like it continued into the first quarter, the substantial amount of delay to wait for the DTN-X to be available and then you ship into them and you recognize revenue very quickly versus if you were to bring in, say, a Tier 1 service provider, it could take 4, 5 quarters for that customer to show up as revenue. And what I'm trying to get a handle on is, is the mix that we're seeing in the first half mainly existing customers that are coming on and that, that mix starts to shift towards newer customers in the back half? Can you just qualitatively talk about that mix shift?Ita M. BrennanYes, I mean, it's tough. We are -- we certainly see a good, strong representation of our own customers in the Q1 and Q2 revenue numbers, right? But at the same time, there's a very meaningful number of new customers who will ramp a little more slowly than an existing customer, right? So for sure, our existing customers are more likely to take larger dollars and have shorter rev-rec, right? But the -- there's a fair representation of new customers there and they are ramping meaningful dollars pretty quickly. We haven't had customers that have taken 4, 5 or 6 quarters to come to revenue. We just don't have that phenomena, right? A long turn-up time for us with a customer to get to multimillion dollars is 2 quarters or thereabouts, so it's not -- we don't see that long tail that you're describing.Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionOne last question and one last crack at it and then I'll cede the floor. So if I were to look at your lead book, if you look back at the customers you've had over the years versus the customers that are new, is there a higher percentage of new customers in your lead book than there has been in prior periods?Ita M. BrennanYes, absolutely. I mean, we are getting access to customers that we didn't have access to before for sure, and those customers have a different profile. They're definitely larger customers, Tier 1 type customers that we can -- that we didn't have access to before.David F. WelchYes, we'll just add on very quickly there. What we've talked about before is the DTN-X brings out a variety of new features, and I want to emphasize we're winning because of those added features, the integration of the OTN, the value of the 500-gig super channels capability of the network. And it's those features that allow us to expand the market space out to a greater set of the new customers and that we seeing the benefits of that market expansion in the new customers.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Subu Subrahmanyan with The Juda Group.Natarajan Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group, Research DivisionMy question was on market growth versus share gain. I know you've talked about it, Tom, but are you thinking that the market growth is also towards the higher end of the range you had earlier expected? Is there a broader inflection point in 100-gig that we're seeing over a lot of this upside from share gain?David F. WelchSo market -- let me define market growth. If I define market growth as the 100-gig, or in our case, the 500-gig market sector, I think that is growing at a good -- very strong clip. It's coming at the negative consequence to 40-gig markets that have existed out there and that's clear we made a transition. So there's quite of wide range of predictions and what the growth rate was for the 100-gig market sector, but I would say that from our experience, we're seeing that, that market sector doing very well.Natarajan Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group, Research DivisionIn terms of long-haul DWDM market, not necessarily the 100 gig?David F. WelchYes, so if I expand to look at 10-gig, 40-gig and 100-gig as an aggregate, I would say that, yes, it's probably on target for what the growth is. I'm not sure that the market growth is -- it's a little hotter, not a lot hotter from that. What we're seeing is a -- we think there is the substantive market share again. It's coming about one. We didn't really participate in the 40-gig market sector and so now that our 100-gig -- now that, that has moved towards 100-gig, we're seeing market share gains for ourselves from that. So it's a mixture of both. We think the -- again, the market expansion for us, new customers we haven't gotten to before. The 100-gig market is doing very well. The total long-haul market sector is doing reasonably well. There seems to be good business out there, but in -- kind of in that order is what's driving our growth.Natarajan Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group, Research DivisionAnd if you could talk about margin? I mean, the last time, you were $130 million in revenue a couple of years ago. Obviously, margins, EPS were much higher. Can you talk about kind of what kind of targets from a revenue perspective should need to be in to think about your long-term operating margin? Obviously, part of that is gross margin improvement from a revenue direction, if you could speak about that.Ita M. BrennanYes, I mean, I think the margin phenomenon that we're seeing right now and through the end of '13 is pretty unique in that it's really -- it's going to be largely driven by 2 factors, right? One, is product mix, right, and getting to a balanced new mix level on the DTN-X. And the second piece of it is that we have -- we just have cost curve that we need to work through, right? So that's why if you look at the guidance for '13, by the time you get to Q4, you do start to see margin expansion to hit that 38% to 40%, right? So I think the 2 biggest drivers in the near term are going to be get down that cost curve, which we see and we are seeing ongoing progress towards that, and then have some product mix and still on the DTN-X, which we're also starting to see, which is the positive sign, right? Beyond that, obviously, as revenues grow, we will get some gross margin flow-through, et cetera, as well. What the revenue number is to hit 45%? It's somewhat more than where we are in '13, but it's really more driven by those 2 factors than it is necessarily going to be the top line in the near term.Natarajan Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group, Research DivisionAnd on operating margin, Ita, to get to your target operating margin range is what kind of revenue number?Ita M. BrennanYes, I mean, it's going to be dependent on the gross. I mean, you get the gross margin up to 45% and thereabouts, then you get -- you start to drive towards that 10% bottom line, right? The key is the gross margin.OperatorOur next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionAnd I joined the call a bit late, so I apologize if you already addressed this, but as far as where you are on the yield curve in terms of your pick for the DTN-X, can you just comment on that? And perhaps if you're able to quantify, if we were to kind of magically be at the ultimate goal of your yields, how much will that contribute to gross margin in terms of points or dollar amount?Ita M. BrennanYes, so I don't know that we're going to talk specifically about the yield in the fab. But I think if you look at our gross margin guidance for the year and kind of the expansion that has to happen in that margin to get to that annual number, it gives us some idea for how we see those cost reduction efforts impacting and helping gross margin through the end of the year.Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionMaybe just to try to ask it another way. If you look at the upside to margin from the kind of the blade versus chassis shift and compare that to the potential upside from improving yields, which one is the larger factor for us to look for in terms of driving upside?Ita M. BrennanYes, I think through the end of year, we're relying more heavily on the cost optimization and cost reductions because we think we'll still be shipping a heavier mix of commons. And then as we move into next year and expand beyond that, it'll come mainly from mix as we start to see the fill on existing networks.Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionOkay, that's helpful. And then second question is, what percent of your sales roughly at this point are coming from customers who are using that new revenue model that's introduced a quarter or 2 ago where you can sell chunks of capacity kind of decoupled from the actual TAMs?Ita M. BrennanYes, I mean, the percentage of revenue at this point is still pretty low, right, and I know we had -- we'd talked about this a little bit but it's a model that will be used by a particular our customer set as opposed to being broad-based, right? So we're seeing it in some key accounts where it fits the customer needs, but it's not driving a significant proportion of revenue.Thomas J. FallonTo me, the importance is that whether or not it's a big part of the revenue. Infinera is passionate around being on the same side of the negotiating table as our customer. Some people want 500-gig at a time, some people want 100 or think they want 100, we offer that. They have the choice of what makes the best economic sense for them. Sometimes, they end up buying the 100 in time and sometimes they come back and say, No, I just want the 500. Our job is to help them build a successful business. We are creating tools that allows them to do that in their markets and allows us the flexibility of a good business model and a fair return for our shareholders.Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionIs it a larger percent of the backlog for you versus what's in the run rate revenues?Ita M. BrennanNo, I mean, I think it's still -- it's a tool to be used kind of in a sales process, but it's not driving a significant portion of our existing Q1 and Q2 revenues. It may do in the future depending on the customer, but right now it's not driving a major portion of our revenue.OperatorAnd we do have time for one last further question. That question comes Sanjiv Wadhwani with Stifel.Sanjiv R. Wadhwani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research DivisionTom, I have a question on gross margins, sort of I wanted to get your thoughts around strategy going forward. I mean, it does seem that you guys are starting to take some share and I'm just fast forwarding, let's say, 2 to 3 quarters from now and let's say your share gains accelerate, trying to figure out if some of your larger competitors then decide to use pricing as one of the mechanisms to sort of stem those gains. Are you sort of going to be participating in that? And just curious if whether you would sacrifice sort of gross margins in the short term just to again those footprints, but pricing is an element?Thomas J. FallonFirst of all, thank you for the congrats on the quarter. Your observation is it's winning market share now. In a few quarters from now, people might want to truncate that by having pricing more. My view is that the market cannot become more competitive than it's been over the last year as this new technology is absorbed into the market. And the market share winners for the long term are going to be defined over the next few quarters and years. There is an intense competition today for that market share. I think that once we or somebody else is in to a customer, to dislodge that competitor, as a primary supplier is very difficult to do just around pricing. It has to be more of a value of network, value of service, quality experience. So I think that, and my view, is that the vast majority of the competitiveness we're already in the midst of, it is rationalizing itself. I think that candidly, as I watch Huawei begin to have challenges on the world stage and extract themselves, I guess, probably what I'm reading is they have stated that they are not interested in the U.S. market anymore. That helps the market. I think that Huawei -- they weren't winning in the market anyway. Certainly, in the United States, they didn't have a differentiated solution. Their customer service and support, I think, was inferior. I think their business practices were inferior. And they did not receive acceptance. Having said that, a number of people have used them as a pricing lever to bring down competitive pricing. I think that there's a more rational view on that. And as people -- companies exit from that -- some certain markets, there's less abnormal behavior to drive irrational pricing. So I am more comfortable that the future will have more rational pricing, not less rational pricing.David F. WelchYes. If I can add a couple of points here also. You need to understand that the -- this transition that is going on right now is not just a transition to a 100-gig, it's a transition to an intelligent transport network. And when you add features such as fast shared mesh protection, as Peter Paul indicated in one of his talks, that was almost a factor or 2 -- could be as much as a factor or 2 benefit in the cost structure of his networks, is far more valuable than the price pressure on a transponder basis. It's the added intelligence that goes into a transponder network with integrated OTN switching, with big super channels on there that creates a better total cost of ownership when looking at the network in entirety and not looking at the historical point-to-point transponder market. It's not -- it's no longer a 10-gig market per se, it is an intelligent transport market that takes big pipes in there to make it efficient.Thomas J. FallonThank you for joining us this afternoon and for your questions. We look forward to staying in touch in the months and quarters ahead, with reports on our continued progress. Have a great day.OperatorAnd with that, we will conclude today's conference. Thank you very much for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.")
# 2013 q2
infn.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Kim Watkins,"
            " Morgan Stanley.Kimberly A. Watkins - Morgan Stanley, Research DivisionIt's Kim Watkins in for Amy Goldblum. Just wanted to ask a little bit to better understand the comments about visibility into orders. I think you said at the end of Q3, which we're not that far away from, wanted to make sure I understand that correctly and if you could give us a little bit more insight into what you think is going on there, that would be really helpful.Ita M. BrennanYes. I mean, I think what we see right now, Kim, is we have good visibility to the first kind of couple of months of Q3 bookings. September, right now, we don't have perfect visibility to that. It's not unusual that, that's the case because August tends to be kind of a quiet month from a decision perspective. But relative to what we have, what we saw in Q2, I think what we're messaging is it's a little bit -- we have a little bit less visibility than we had in Q2. It's almost back to how this business typically is and our lead times are back to what they would historically have been, right, and nothing more than that.Kimberly A. Watkins - Morgan Stanley, Research DivisionSo do you think -- I mean, obviously, not increasing your guidance for the year implies a pretty sharp decline in the December quarter. Do you think we're getting at the tail end of kind of the easy pickings of DTN-X deployments at this point? I mean, it seems like you've got quite a large backlog of customers. So just trying to get a feel for what is changing in the momentum of the business.Ita M. BrennanYes. I mean I think we're saying that it's the upper end of the guidance or better, we're just not ready to define how much that better would be until we have better visibility, right.Thomas J. FallonYes. We were very careful in saying that our guidance, from a floor perspective, is at the high end of our old range and we're not giving a new top end range, and that those with visibility that we have historically seen, but we've seen better visibility over the last couple of quarters. As Ita said, this is fairly typical for our company's history and it's exacerbated by our belief that time is a weapon and as we bring lead times down for our 100-gig product, to the 4- to 6-week range, we end up training our customers around having that expectation. I think that provides a competitive advantage to us and our customers in the industry. It does lead to less visibility across the horizon, but I think it's worth doing. I do see a lot of opportunities, still, around the world. There are a lot of big opportunities that we are working to achieve. So I don't see any falloff in what I consider industry demand for transport technology. I just see, as Ita said, maybe some of it's Q3, from a summer softness perspective, but mostly it's just a visibility that we have trained our customers and potential customers to have.Kimberly A. Watkins - Morgan Stanley, Research DivisionOkay, that's really helpful. And then how does the guidance for gross margins fit into that? Because I think we've been trained to think about it as once you deploy the common equipment which typically has lower margins and you start to sell the chassis, you end up a little bit higher margin business, but that also leads me to think that the chassis deployments are slowing down. So what's the context there of higher gross margin in the quarter?Ita M. BrennanYes, I mean and certainly, if you look at the revenue guidance for Q3, nothing is slowing down in that guidance, right. So I think what we're seeing is we have some customers who had deployed DTN in their networks and the line system that goes with the DTN, which is what we call common equipment for this purpose is leverageable to DTN-X, if they want to put DTN-X and upgrade to DTN-X on the fiber, right. so we are seeing, this quarter, a number of larger networks where we're actually going to leverage the line system for the DTN-X deployment, and that's helping us with the product mix perspective. I mean, I look at it as it just shows what the model can do when there will be a more balanced mix, but this mix change is really a positive thing, it's customers leveraging what they already have.Thomas J. FallonI also think it's very important not to draw a conclusion that DTN-X wins are slowing down. As I stated, we had 7 in 1 quarter and we think that that's a very strong and healthy number. And some of those, as Ita said, are going to take advantage of an optical infrastructure they've already deployed. It's customers who like the DTN experience and want to have the DTN-X experience, and are using that optical infrastructure. Some are new customers that will have new line systems, et cetera. I think the real resonance should be 45 points. We've gotten some concerns from people, is 45 points of margin really an intermediate-term target. This is a great proof point, that when you have a nice mix of new wins and customers upgrading old networks, 45 points is a very realistic number, even when you're picking up market share.Kimberly A. Watkins - Morgan Stanley, Research DivisionAbsolutely. One other quick question about the competitive landscape. I mean, certainly, this isn't showing up in your P&L, but just out of curiosity, have you seen any changes in Alcatel-Lucent now that they're a little bit healthier from at least a balance sheet perspective and a competitive standpoint?Thomas J. FallonWell, I'm not sure borrowing money makes them more healthy from a balance sheet perspective, but that's a different discussion for a different time. I think it's too early to state whether the new CEO is going to insist on new business practices. I think that they have a significant challenge ahead of them. I still interface with customers who are concerned about increasing their dependence on any supplier that is fiscally uncertain. So I think that the proof will still be in the pudding.OperatorRod Hall, JPMC.Ashwin Kesireddy - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionThis is Ashwin in behalf or Rod. I think my first question is on revenue guidance. You already commented on visibility. Now, what do you think can happen during the quarter, which can probably push the numbers above your guided range? In other terms, what other surprises are sort of [indiscernible] from this guidance?Ita M. BrennanYes. I mean, clearly, the guidance we provided for Q3 is based on our best visibility that we have now, and that's our view of how the quarter is going to turn out. If there are surprises, there'll be surprises, right. I mean it's not that we see other things that we haven't incorporated in here. I think that's our best view of the quarter as we sit here today.Ashwin Kesireddy - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionAll right. I just got another sort of housekeeping question. I think last quarter you mentioned that you had like 26% market share in total 100-gig port shipments. Is there any update to that number?Thomas J. FallonThose market share update numbers that we reference are from public firms, Infonetics and Dell'Oro typically. And those numbers won't be updated, typically, until the middle of August.OperatorGeorge Notter, Jefferies.George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC, Research DivisionI wanted to ask about your experience with the trade-off between the DTN and the DTN-X. And you've got a year I guess, now, of experience with the DTN-X and can you just talk about anything you can say quantitatively or even qualitatively about how customers view the DTN versus the DTN-X? Are you seeing a lot of cannibalization on the DTN? What's the experience like?Thomas J. FallonWell, I think that our customers that have upgraded into the DTN-X, are reflecting that they expect and are seeing the same ease-of-use, the same quality, the same rapid fulfillment, the same fundamental experience that they fell in love with at the DTN. They're expecting that with the DTN-X and they're getting that with the DTN-X. I think that for new customers, clearly, what they're intrigued by is our reputation around quality and customer service, but also our cutting edge and leading technology. Nobody else can provide 500-gig super channel on a single card, point-and-click provision 2-terabit capacity in 12 minutes. It doesn't exist on the planet except with us. So we're creating a new terabit-age-ready platform available to the market today. Customers get it. Is it cannibalizing the DTN? It's kind of a funny way to look at it, George. We're clearly selling the DTN-X today where the DTN would've sold before. But the DTN caps out at 400 gigs of capacity. The DTN-X, once we put a terabit line card in there, caps out at 10 terabits of capacity. You're not going to use that product for that solution if you're only going to carry 200 gigs. There's a big market, still, for the DTN. We continue to win new DTN customers, but it's for applications where bandwidth requirements aren't going to the multiple terabit range. The DTN-X adds a new tool to our toolbox, allowing us to sell a product in the core, allowing us to sell product in regions and in metros. So I think that cannibalization is probably the wrong way to look at it. Somebody has a very high capacity network, they would have bought something other than the DTN. Blessedly, they're buying the DTN-X.George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC, Research DivisionGot it. Yes. I guess just to clarify the question, I don't think there's any debate here about the fact that your market opportunity is much, much bigger now with the DTN-X in the mix. I guess I was just curious about where the ultimate revenue stream for the company can go. Obviously, there's kind of 2 parts of that: How much success you have with the DTN-X and what component of that revenue stream then kind of goes away with the heritage DTN shrinking to some extent. That was kind of the gist of the question and so I was kind of wondering if you could say anything qualitatively or quantitatively in terms of what percentage of the customers do you think will ultimately go for the DTN-X, what percentage of the revenue stream might that be. I mean, any clarification there I think would be kind of helpful to understand the upside case of Infinera.Ita M. BrennanYes. I mean I think the way to look at it, George, is still to come back to, we have DTN customers who are moving to DTN-X and they're spending the same amount of money or more, because we're expanding inside those accounts, on the DTN-X and with Infinera, right. So metrics that I think help see where the expansion is going to be is looking at -- out of the 34 new purchase commitments that we have, new customers buying the DTN-X, 1/3 of those are new customers, right. So that's obviously completely incremental revenue to the company, right. You also saw this quarter that had -- we saw a lot of customers, who are on that list, now buying more DTN-X, right. So I think we have to look at it from, are we expanding geographically. We're seeing traction in APAC, and we've talked about that. That was an insignificant market for us before, right. And then we're seeing these new customers being added to that list and that's what's going to drive the growth.Thomas J. FallonAnd it's important to realize, too, George, that if somebody is a DTN customer and they start buying the DTN-X, they're not throwing away the DTNs typically. They are continuing to fill, they're continuing to add capacity, too, and in some cases, continuing to extend applications into other parts of their network. So most of the time, it's not replacement revenue, it's incremental revenue.George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC, Research DivisionGot it. Okay, great. And then one last question, just on gross margin. I was just sort of thinking about the move from 36% last quarter to 39% now this quarter. And Ita, you've talked about the different pieces of gross margin improvement. Obviously, you get a yield improvement on the PIC chip fab. You get just volume improvements, leverage on manufacturing. Can you parse out, for the Q2, the components of the margin expansion? Was it mostly from the yield improvements? Was it mostly from cost down? Anything you can give us there would be helpful.Ita M. BrennanYes. I mean, I think from Q1 to Q2, it's moved along pretty much in line with what we expected, and the majority of it is coming from cost, right, and from cost improvements both on the PIC and on the other elements of the DTN-X platform, right. We're still -- in Q2 for sure, we had a heavy mix of common equipment, et cetera, so we're not really getting that much from mix in Q2. Our outlook for Q3 definitely incorporates some benefits from being able to leverage some existing common equipment in networks, et cetera, but we're also getting incremental cost reductions into Q3 as well, right. So we're continuing to execute to that roadmap that we had laid out, which has the margin expanding through the end of the year, on the back of the cost reductions, and then some of the upside that we're seeing is coming from customer mix or from product mix in that time period.OperatorDmitry Netis, William Blair.Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research DivisionGot a couple of quick questions here. On the acceleration of OpEx, you're guiding it up a little. I'm just trying to parse this a bit and if you could comment -- and also your guidance as far as the timing, and maybe less of a visibility towards the back end of the Q3, Q4. Does this have anything to do with your ability to expedite orders? The fact that you're raising your R&D investments up a little here, you're trying to get the product out in time for customers, what's driving the OpEx up? Trying to parse this thing, if you could help, that'd be great.Ita M. BrennanYes. I think the biggest driver for the OpEx growth is all around variable comp, both sales and other variable comp. I mean, if you look at the 215 is the upper end of the range, and there's about $6 million of increased variable comp in that number, which puts you back at a 209 type number, which is really not up significantly from last year, right. So the vast majority of the growth is coming from those drivers. We do have some incremental R&D spend where we're just moving and accelerating some R&D activities as we see that as being important versus our future growth. But I wouldn't link that, in any way, to the fact that this is Q3 and we are not seeing the same strength or visibility in Q3 as we saw in Q2.Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research DivisionOkay. So you're able to ship product. This is not a product constrained environment you're in right now?Ita M. BrennanYes. I mean, at $135 million to $145 million, we're shipping more revenue and more products than we have historically and we can ship a lot more.Thomas J. FallonAnd our lead times are at target. So roughly 4 to 5 weeks after an order, we're able to fulfill that order. So we are not experiencing the constraints and we've prided ourselves that we think time is a weapon and I think, like I said, part of the reason that some of the visibility is down is because we are training customers as we've trained them on the DTN. We are going to be there when you need it.Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research DivisionOkay, great. And then on the customer side, did you have any 10% customers this quarter? I apologize, I joined a little bit late.Ita M. BrennanYes. So we had no 10% customers. We had a couple that were just under the 10%, and then we said the top 5 customers, we had 2 MSOs, 2 bandwidth wholesalers and 1 Tier 1 in the top 5.Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research DivisionOkay. And then for the new guys that are following the stock now, would you give us a bit of a view on those top 5 customers and how much they might represent as a percentage of revenue? Is it less than 50% or is it more than...Ita M. BrennanYes, it would be less than 50%. I mean, yes, we don't have the same customer concentration as you might have seen historically. Yes, those 5 customers are significant in the quarter and then they rotate in and out with a fair amount of variability and who's in that top 5 customer list every quarter.Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research DivisionOkay, great. That's helpful. And then the last question, kind of the metro opportunity and how positioned are you in terms of your product base. Right now, I'm not sure, I think in the past you've played in the metro. It was a combo solution where you had the ATN plus the DTN. Are you doing similar thing right now with the DTN-X, where you're basically linking the ATN with the DTN-X? Have you had that kind of deployment or -- that's sort of the one question. And then the second, if you could update us on sort of the new product that potentially could fit that market segment. And specifically, I know you play in the core, but maybe more toward the access side of the network or the edge side of the network.Thomas J. FallonYes. So, today, we are using the ATN as an aggregation and feeder into both DTN and DTN-X. We have had customers that are buying that configuration, and having 2 of them together has been very useful. In the core metros, we do sell quite a bit of DTN. We sell a reasonable amount of DTN-X. Some of the new customers we've won actually have been core metro applications, and we have articulated an expectation that we are developing a metro platform, a new metro platform to complement the DTN and the ATN. We have not released a timeline on that, but we did say that it was going to be PIC-based. That PIC is in development and we anticipate having working PIC modules this calendar year, as kind of a milestone that you can measure success against. Beyond that, you're going to have to wait for product updates when we officially feel comfortable talking about products.OperatorMike Genovese, MKM Partners.Michael Genovese - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionGiven that you have no 10% customers in the quarter, given your market share, it seems like your comments about what you're saying, about an order void in August is a comment about the industry, more than specific to you guys. But also isn't that normal? I mean, wouldn't you normally expect that? And I guess the question that I'm trying to drive at is the question of should we think about 4Q '13 being a – or 4Q, just in general, being a seasonally strong quarter? I mean it used to be years ago. Hasn't proven to be the last couple of years, and I'm talking more for the industry than you guys. But in this part of the market, you guys are becoming the industry. So what's your view on seasonality of the fourth quarter? And are you just using this order void to stay conservative on both the full year revenue guide and the gross margins? Both seem like they should go up. Are you just using this to stay conservative here or is this something you're really worried about?Thomas J. FallonWell, first of all, you used the word void a couple of times and that's not a word we used. So I caution that we don't see an order void. That's a very fundamentally different type of worry that I would have if we saw an order void. What we're seeing is more typical industry demand and profiles of demand that, one, is a little bit typical of Q3 and is also reflective of our lead times being back at what we consider to be good lead times for our customers. We still see, as I mentioned, a number of big and good opportunities across the world and in all of our vertical markets where we are seeing, not a void, but right now, lack of clarity on when those people are going to make their final decisions. I continue to believe that the market for transport is growing, at probably what the industry says is 10% or so. And we continue to pick up market share; actually we've been picking up, I would guess market share, at an accelerating rate. That rate can't continue at the pace it's been at, but I do continue to believe we are going to pick up market share in a growing market. I do think that there is some lack of visibility, though not a void of opportunities where we're seeing, late in this quarter, which is like I said, more typical, and Ita said, more typical of the business that we're used to for the last several years. In regard to margin, we're not trying to explain away something that you might think is going to be up higher later. It's very important to understand that our margins in Q3, as we try to very aggressively win footprint, are being very favorably impacted by the fact that some of the footprint we are winning in Q3 is going on top of line systems that we sold over the last several years. That is, to me, a very good metric that we have satisfied those customers. They want to continue to have the Infinera experience. They're leveraging the investment they made historically. But typically, when we win new customers, that is not going to be how they roll out product. Typically, they're building a new network, even if it is a current customer. And I think that we guided at the beginning of the year, 38% to 48% margin. We are still very resolute that we are reaffirming that 38% to 40% margin. Clearly, Q3 is ahead of our margin guidance for this year, but it reflects what we've said is our intermediate goal and I think it's, as Ita said, a great proof point, that when you have a nice mix of fill and new wins, it's a very achievable model.Michael Genovese - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionCould you comment on the seasonality question? I mean, like I said, the last couple years the fourth quarter for the industry hasn't been that great. Do you think that that's kind of the new way of things? It used to always be a big double-digit up company for carrier selling things like you -- I mean, for vendors selling things like you sell. Do you think that that's changed? And then also, finally, on the gross margins, just a hypothetical question, which is that if you did have a 20% customer, if you were to win a 20% customer, say, that was building a nationwide network with you guys, how would that affect the gross margin trajectory that you're on? I'm not talking about the third quarter gross margins, but just general, the gross margin improvement, knowing that the cost of the PICs are coming down. Do you think a large deployment, if someone were to become a sustainable 20% customer, would that affect your gross margins over a short period of time?Ita M. BrennanYes. I mean, I think, Mike, the way to think about gross margins is we had laid out a roadmap that, ahead of exiting the year, above 40% gross margin. In the low 40s in Q4. And we're not changing that and we haven't moved away from that in anything that we've said today. What we've tried to do is to caution against taking the Q3 margin and expanding that up from 45%. So that's kind of our intention around the gross margin trajectory, just to be clear. Your question about would a 20% customer change that margin and what would that look like. We're carrying a lot of common equipment right now, in the revenue model and in the gross margin model. So if somebody came and dumped an entire Pan-Americas network into a single quarter, that will drive the margin down, but if we see normal rollouts with these guys, we'd like to believe that doesn't fall below 45% in that scenario. So I think, is there a case, a hypothetical case, where it could? Yes, but it would be coming with some fairly significant, and not typical roll out of a large network.Thomas J. FallonI don't think that you should expect a customer to take 20% of our output, in a given quarter, and roll it out and recognize revenue in that quarter. It's too much network to deploy that quickly. It'll be much more metered out. Second of all, your question in regard to Q4 seasonality, my personal view is that, in the industry, there will be some Q4 upside in end-of-year money. I think that industry, in general, is growing. I think that there are opportunities that are occurring. And around the world, I see companies getting more comfortable with the economic outlook, and I think that, that will allow people to have some end-of-year money to spend. How big it'll be, I don't know. How much of it will it get to Infinera, I don't know. But I do believe there will be some Q4 opportunities that we don't see yet.Ita M. BrennanAnd again, just to reiterate, I mean, we're saying we'll be at the upper end or above. But we're reluctant to try to quantify that above right now, and that's the extent of the caution that we're putting there.OperatorAlex Henderson, Needham & Company.Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionI got a couple of questions for you. The first one, I just wanted to delve into the third quarter guide a little bit. So it sounded like, from the answers in the last question set, that there's a fair amount of what I would describe as legacy 10-gig networks being deployed on the DTN, as opposed to DTN-X sales that are in that quarter. Is that what's driving that increase in comm equipment?Ita M. BrennanNo. I think the way to look at it is, we're seeing very healthy DTN-X deployments, but some of those DTN-X deployments are not requiring us to ship new line systems comm equipment. So the DTN business is actually holding up very well and it's very consistent to what we'd originally planned. We're seeing ongoing fill into those networks and we're also seeing some new deployments for DTN.Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionSo does that mean that the DTNs that were placed in the prior 2 or 3 quarters, are now pulling new blade sales to go in them?Thomas J. FallonNo.Ita M. BrennanWell, so DTN networks that are deployed, that customers are going to leave in place, are going to continue to be filled with additional capacity. We have some customers where they've maxed out fiber and now they're placing the DTN with DTN-X, and they're leveraging all of the common equipment that's already in place. We've got both of those dynamics happening in that revenue guidance.Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionOkay. So it's a replacement of a DTN with a DTN-X and sharing the comm equipment that's already in place for it that's driving that. Okay. That helps a lot. So as you look forward into the activity rates that you're looking at, the number of deals that you're chasing, the size of the deals that you're chasing, getting away from the seasonality of whether people order in the middle of August or whether they take vacations, do you think that the order activity, the number of deals you're chasing, the size of the deals you're chasing, are larger than prior periods? Are they accelerating? Is your order book increasing sequentially? Can you characterize that a little bit for us?Thomas J. FallonI would say it is a healthy opportunity pipeline of both requests for information, requests for proposals and trials. The Q2 activity I had commented on was that we had not seen Q2 activity at that level, probably in the history of our company. Q2 was a particularly robust quarter from an activities and pipeline. I would say the environment we're seeing today is a good environment, but it is more spaced over time. There are a lot of big opportunities around the world, but I would say it's more of a good environment versus the [indiscernible] we've seen.Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionOkay. And then can you talk little bit about the problems that Huawei is having competing and how -- whether that's impacting your share position and your opportunities and getting into some of the installed base that they've got out there, potentially even replacing them in places?Thomas J. FallonWell, clearly, in North America, they publicly have stated they're no longer interested in doing business in North America and that makes the competitive environment against them fairly benign. In Europe, there are starting to be hackles raised around is there a risk or not here. So I think the European community is some period of time behind North America in regard to, is there concern over network security. Whether it's going to impact short-term decision-making or not, I think it's too early to tell. I think that we're going to have to asses, over time, whether that takes on tangible meaning in Europe or not. I think that it already is impacting, certainly when we're dealing with international wholesalers who are exchanging capacity and doing data exchanges with North America wholesalers and independents, there is a concern of their ability to win business if they are using an infrastructure from China. That is certainly helping us to either win business or keep the Chinese suppliers having a more difficult time winning the business. But I think it's too early to understand what the impact might be in Europe. Clearly, in North America, the impact has been fundamental.Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionOne last question and this one's a little bit longer term in nature. You're obviously very well positioned in regional and long-haul applications. As you get into the metro, there's a lot more legacy, SONET, SDH and all kinds of other nonsense to integrate with. But I've been out with several industry execs that have talked about the metro market being potentially 10x the size of the long-haul backbone when that conversion finally starts in size, which some people think that we'll see the toes of that S curve in the middle of next year and then really ramp it into '15, '16 and beyond. How would you describe your view of your competitive position in the metro market given the advantages around the OEO conversion and the switching functionality versus your -- on a magnitude basis, the advantages that you have in the long haul piece? Is it larger advantage in metro market when you get into that more complex switching environment?Thomas J. FallonI think that, historically, people have divided long-haul for metro based mostly on the attribute of reach. And I think with current technologies, that is probably the wrong metric to look at. We really think about capacity and services. In long haul, it requires huge amounts of capacity, large switching capability and long reach. In the metro regionals, it requires the same type of thing, but less reach. But the technology makes that irrelevant. So we now, really, more think about it as high capacity requirements and lower capacity requirements. For higher-capacity markets, in areas like metro regional and core, I think the advantages of our PIC and our ability to very effectively have the ability to integrate switching and GMPLS control have the same fundamental advantages they do in the core but probably at a bigger scale, because you're doing more traffic management. As you get closer to the edge, services become more important and that's where our ATN has played a role, historically, of taking and aggregating those services into our DTN or DTN-X. I think the opportunity for us, for our new metro portfolio, is to take the value proposition of the PIC, the value proposition of our integrated switching, whether it's an OTN or MPLS, the opportunity of having a GMPLS network control across the entire network is a huge advantage. But right now, we don't have that platform. So at the services edge, I would say that we have some catching up to do. I do not believe the numbers that the metro opportunity is 10x that of the core. The core is probably a $4 billion market plus, growing to $6 billion or so. It's implausible, in my mind, that the metro market is going to grow from a $5 billion market to a $50 billion or $60 billion around services. I just don't see that as being viable at all.Operator[Operator Instructions] The next question is from Subu Subrahmanyan, Juda Group.Natarajan Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group, Research DivisionTom, if you don't mind, I want to address the guidance question again. If revenue for September is at the midpoint and full year guidance, just the high-end of the range, and I know you said high end or higher, it would imply December down double-digit in a typically seasonally strong quarter. And I know you're not guiding to that, but I'm trying to understand, given that the business tends to be lumpy, if there some large deals which are kind of tailing off out of the September quarter, which makes you think that December could be down or is it just, at this point, you don't have the visibility? I'm wondering if there are specific deals then you have visibility of where that starts to tail off.Thomas J. FallonWell, Subu, just to reiterate the guidance, we took the new guidance to the bottom being the former high-end of our previous guidance and we gave no upper limit to that. What we're trying to articulate as clearly as we can, we're confident in our business. The current results are outstanding, Q3 looks like an outstanding quarter for results, but as our visibility gets less certain, we are going to become -- pass that uncertainty on and say this is what we see. We have no reason not to believe that our business is in a good position, but our visibility is less and I think that we've tried to be clear that, historically, both Ita and I have said, we're going to guide to what we can see. We got a little bit, I think -- I don't know, out of sync a little bit with some of the analysts when we gave a 1-year outlook last year because we thought that, with the DTN-X introduction, what we could see was not reflective of the opportunity that we knew was there. As we go back to more typical business process, we're going to go move to just quarterly announcements or quarterly guidance, and this is directionally in that tone. There's nothing that I am concerned with, about the DTN-X losing viability and leadership in the market. But with less visibility of our sales guys being to look me in the eye and tell me we're going to win this deal at this time frame, we're going to pass on that level of lack of clarity to you.Ita M. BrennanYes. And I think, Subu, you're right, that will be $120 million quarter or so in Q4, which clearly would be a different trajectory. We're not saying that's what's going to happen. What we're saying is it's difficult because the timing in that last quarter, to basically size any upside to the original 20%. And it's -- we have a lot of deals in the pipeline but the timing of when they actually get executed on and how much of that will fall into Q4 as revenue is something that we're just going to have to see how it plays out. But again the momentum is there. This is more a timing of what will show up in revenue in Q4.Natarajan Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group, Research DivisionUnderstood. I guess my question was, are there existing large deals that are playing out in 2Q and 3Q, which may be tapering off into Q which needs to be filled by some new deals? Is there that kind of a dynamic?Ita M. BrennanI mean our model is that you're always going to have to have a number of large deployments in every quarter, to make our revenue numbers where we typically see them. So it's not a question of that top 5 customer list rotates every quarter. So there will be and will need to be key wins, either with new or existing customers, in each quarter. And that's what we've been seeing and we would expect to continue to see that. But you need -- to call those for Q4 from now, that's -- we just don't have the visibility to call those yet. They're definitely there, to be won. But which ones hit and when? We're just not willing to kind of go and increase that 20% growth rate just yet.Natarajan Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group, Research DivisionUnderstood. And Tom, generally, lumpiness in the market, how are you thinking about lumpiness in the market? We've seen, obviously, a good phase of growth as 100-Gs on an early part of the trajectory for growth. But optical traditionally has been a lumpy business and over the next few quarters, how do you think about that?Thomas J. FallonWell, I like to think about it, first, over the next few years. Over the next few years, I see huge opportunity. I see that there's a fundamental requirement for more transmission. I see that in all the same trajectories, video, wireless, cloud, all those are continuing to be extraordinarily robust. I see an absolute shift in the market to 100-gig, to 500-gig, to terabit and I see an absolute shift to the market to convergence. I don't know of anybody better positioned to take advantage and accelerate those convergence or those trajectories than we are. So I feel very fortunate with where we are across the next several years. Now if you bring that timeframe down to a shorter period of time, across quarters, I think, in our industry, Q1 is always a soft quarter. It's always going to be a soft quarter. So I think there's going to be continued lumpiness and there's always going to be certain big deals that drive big opportunities. That's not going to change. So I think volatility, quarter-to-quarter, should be somewhat expected, with a general trajectory of up and to the right.Natarajan Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group, Research DivisionAnd final question, you talked about gross margin exiting the year at a 40%-plus kind of rate, which you've talked about. I just wanted to understand, was that a specific reference to the December quarter that would -- you connected at 40% or higher? And another bigger picture question is it seems like we can either have big footprint growth which drives revenue or good margins with line card mix. When can we hit that kind of steady-state where we can have both at a mid-40% gross margin?Ita M. BrennanYou're going to move to it over time. First of all, the commentary on the Q4 is just referencing back to our guidance of 38% to 40% and the fact that, to achieve that, we would expect it to be exiting the low 40s, and we're holding to that commitment that we would exit in the low 40s. I think from a, when do we see this margins get to this 45% on a steady-state ongoing basis, it's as the mix of what we revenue becomes more balanced between fill and common equipment. And we are starting to see some DTN-X fill go into the networks that we deployed a year ago. So we definitely see the fill levels starting to come. But again, we would hope that next year we're going to be deploying a ton of common equipment for new customers and we're going to want to do that, and that's going to kind of constrain the margin for a while.Thomas J. FallonAnd is the line card fill this quarter DTN or DTN-X or both?Ita M. BrennanBoth. So we expected to see the DTN hold and it's holding, and we're starting to see probably DTN-X fill a little more accelerated than what we would've thought in Q3.Thomas J. FallonYes, if anything, we're pleasantly surprised by customers who deployed DTN-X in the last year, mostly in of the last half of year, starting to come back and needing to expand the fundamental capacity ahead of what they thought. So to me, it goes back to my comment a minute ago, the horizon looks pretty strong from an opportunity of continuing to support incremental bandwidth needs.Thomas J. FallonThank you for joining us this afternoon for your questions. We look forward to staying in touch in the months and quarters ahead, with your report on our continued progress. Thanks very much.OperatorThank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.")
# 2013 q3
infn.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Simona Jankowski"
            " from Goldman Sachs.Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionI just was putting together the slightly lower out-quarter guidance with the lower margins in the quarter, or excuse me, with the higher margins in the quarter, which seem to indicate that perhaps some of the -- kind of the new footprint opportunities are either pushed out or maybe there is just the gap in how those are lattering into the business. So can you just dig into that point a little bit more and just talk a little bit about what are the puts and takes that seem to have impacted the guidance in the out quarter and the mix in the third quarter?Ita M. BrennanYes. So Simona, I think if you look back to our last call, we had talked about margins being higher in Q3 and then kind of coming back down in Q4. And that was because we had a number of pretty significant network deployments where we weren't going to actually be deploying the amplifiers in some of the other lower-margin stuff because they were actually upgrading Samsung DTN footprint, right. So that was definitely part of our expected higher margin performance in Q3, and we didn't expect to see that again in Q4. On top of that, in Q3, we saw some really pretty healthy DTN-X fill that was probably a surprise versus our guidance. And then also, services and services margins actually came in a little bit higher than we would've expected as well. So that's kind of the Q3 story. We fast forward to Q4. We have some very large deployments in Q4. They don't necessarily have the same level of first infill that we saw in some of the deals in Q3. And some of them are also international where there's a lot of services activities. And we think the margins in services may also be a little lower on some of those. That's kind of the bridge between the 2 quarters.Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionBut as far as just looking towards sequential decline in the quarter that's typically up at least from a seasonality perspective, was there anything that -- was either a competitive situation that you would have hoped to win and you didn't? Or is it purely timing? Or was it just difficult comps -- you had a bunch of big quarters out of the gate when you launched the DTN-X, and perhaps, you can't sustain that same pace? It's just somewhat atypical to have a down quarter in December.Ita M. BrennanYes. I mean, we have been pretty clear on the last call that we weren't sure that Q4 was going to necessarily have the same trend that it would have historically, just given kind of the 100-gig cycle and what's happening, right. But I think it's very much timing, I mean, you heard Tom's remarks about -- in the midterm, we are seeing lots of opportunities, and there are a lot of deployments that we see in the pipeline. It really is a timing of when can you -- it could end up taking revenue on some of those.Thomas J. FallonYes, Simona. This is Tom. I would reiterate that. I'm very comfortable in the intermediate range time frame. I am more bullish than I have been on what I see. There's a number of deals that we've actually won, but they won't start deploying during kind of a Q4 moratorium on new builts that we'll start seeing next year. I think we've been trying to be pretty consistent that this industry and our company are still going to have some level of volatility quarter-to-quarter. But I am very confident and comfortable with both the market share we're gaining, the customers that we are winning and the RFP activity that I feel -- nothing's done until it's done, but I think we're very well-positioned in the intermediate term to add some very significant customers.OperatorOur next question comes from George Notter with Jefferies.George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC, Research DivisionBack to the gross margin discussion, I think you guys referenced in the monologue something about some pent-up revenue recognition on the services side, and that having an impact on gross margins. Could you walk through that again?Ita M. BrennanYes. I'm not sure that we said there was pent-up rev-rec, but we did have some large services projects that concluded in the quarter. And a chunk of those were in North America, which is a more established kind of higher-margin service model for us. So that did -- if you look at the margins on services, they're off probably 4 or 5 points on the services piece. So that did help kind of the overall growth margin as well.George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC, Research DivisionGot it. Okay. So just to be clear, the costs associated with those services projects, I believe, are incurred as you -- as time passes, as you work on those projects, and then the service revenue then gets triggered upon completion. Isn't that how the rev-rec works?Ita M. BrennanNo. So the cost and the revenue are kind of moved together, right? So if you're working on a project and you're accumulating costs, those costs are deferred on the balance sheet, along with any perspective revenue. And then when you complete the project, you recognize the revenue and the costs, right? So this isn't that there were no costs kind of in period or less costs in period. From an accounting perspective, it's more that just these particular projects had a higher profitability.George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC, Research DivisionGot it. Okay. So then if I'm just trying to just still -- I guess as I'm trying to look at service, margins for the products side of the company, I can just eliminate the whole services discussion on margins and get a good look at that. Okay, anything else that was unusual in terms of rev-rec or the margin discussion that we can point to?Ita M. BrennanYes. I mean, it was really -- we knew that we were going to have some deployments that would drive a higher gross margin in the quarter, right. I think, but we were surprised by a little bit as how much DTN-X fill we actually saw in some of the deployments that we completed in Q3. And when you look at Q4, some of these built deployments do not have that same initial field profile, right. So it's really a product mix story more than anything else in the quarter.Thomas J. FallonTo me, George, one of the things that's interesting is it's a proof point to me of both our intermediate and longer-range targets. And, typically, as I've been pretty consistent on, at this point, we have the rollout of a new platform, I don't want margins that are too high because it reflects too much fill and not enough footprint. Q3 is an exception to that because we had a couple of customers, who actually had very big new footprint deployments, but they are actually decommissioning their old DTN network using the amplifiers that were in place and putting on 100-gig or 500-gig super-channel networks. That's going to be unusual. Very few customers will do that. And that's why I'm actually delighted with the margin because it's a proof point.George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC, Research DivisionGot it. And then, the other question I have -- I'm sorry, go ahead.David F. WelchI have one more point on that. You think about is, is that, we're still a year into the product, right, which means I've got a non-stabilized mixture of commons versus fill, all right? And it takes a couple of years for the margins of any particular distribution of portfolio or customers across that to fully develop. And you'll see a little bit of that ups and downs associated with that.George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC, Research DivisionGot it. Okay. That makes sense. And then just -- another question I have was on visibility. I think you were talking about visibility looking good over the intermediate term in that, I think, product lead times were shorter. Can you just walk us through that again? And how do you view that in light of the comments last quarter? Talking about having 2 months of visibility and less visibility into the third month of the quarter. How does that shape up now as we look into the December quarter?Thomas J. FallonYes, let me take you back to Q2. In Q2, we said that visibility short-term was probably at an all-time high. And in Q3, I reflected that visibility was probably more normal. It was not as good as it was in Q2 in the short term. I would say this quarter, my view is that the short-term visibility is not distinctly different than it was a quarter ago. But I'm adding to it my view that the intermediate-term visibility is as good or better than I've seen it. And usually, I don't comment on intermediate visibility, but I try to be transparent. Contracts that we're winning today or have won recently, they will start creating revenue opportunity for us early next year. They won't be for Q4. So like the short-term visibility is kind of what it was last quarter, intermediate-term visibility is significantly better.OperatorOur next question comes from Dmitry Netis with William Blair.Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research DivisionIta, so just a clarification there. Are you taking -- at a new startup, are you taking the CEO role?Ita M. BrennanNo. CFO. I'm not sure I'd make a pretty good CEO.Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research DivisionOkay. I'm just wondering. Okay. And then on the Tier 1 customer you announced last quarter, I guess that's Rostelecom?Thomas J. FallonThat's correct.Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research DivisionAnd you mentioned the 500,000 kilometers of fiber. What percentage of that...Thomas J. FallonI'm sorry. You cut out.Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research DivisionFootprint of 500,000 kilometers of fiber is won by Infinera in this case?Thomas J. FallonYes. We've got our first deployment with them. It's a very small amount of fiber coverage today. And this has to be our opportunity. Anybody like this, it's -- one, how do you compel them to put you in their network? Two, you have to dazzle them with quality, ease of use, reliability, integrated OTN, with switching or with transport and create a new experience for them. And then you have the opportunity to go and hunt within their broader network for those opportunities. So as a percentage of their overall network, it's very, very small today. Our opportunity is we've now opened the door. We have our foot in the door, and we have to go and dazzle and make them a significant customer over time.Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research DivisionOkay, great. That's helpful. And then on the strategic -- I think you made a very clear comment here that you expect new strategic customers to be won over the, I guess, next 12 to 18 months. Any color as to whether those will be U.S. customers, international customers. How should we think about it? Where is traffic going to come from?Thomas J. FallonI think they will be customers, certainly, in North America. They will be customers in Europe. We'll have opportunities in APAC, and none of them will come from China.Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research DivisionSounds good. All right, very good. And then I guess, my last question would be just -- if you have any comment on the Korean acquisition of Tellabs. I know they have now a long-hauled product. They've got the Metro product, certainly putting the pieces and puzzles together there. And does that affect Infinera? Is that a good or bad thing that's sort of happening in the market? I know there are some large Tier 1 Customers, and how does that sort of affect you or position you in the market? Any color on that would be helpful, Tom.Thomas J. FallonI think, quite frankly, it's healthy for the market. We've long said that the industry has to consolidate. And that this is, I think, the continuation of the beginning of that process. I think having fewer participants, healthy participants, in the market is a good thing for everybody. Second of all, I think it reflects that the size of your company in this industry does matter. We're trying to get there organically by winning large, strategic accounts and market share. They're doing it inorganically, but size is relevant. And I think that we've long believed that, and I think they reflect that. I think that they have a different approach than we do. They're looking at, in my mind, installed base value versus technology differentiation value. We are deep technology innovators. We value the technology disruptions that we think we could bring to market. That is not the path that I view them on. And I think that in my view, anytime these things happen in the industry, I'm going to go and try to work very hard on focusing on their current customers, while they figure out organization structures and who to fire. So I'm doing it as a good opportunity for Infinera.Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research DivisionAnd your Metro pick, is that still on track, Tom?Thomas J. FallonYes. We said before that we would deliver prototypes, working prototypes, this calendar year. We are on track to do that this quarter. But I would -- we are, as I've stated before, we have our sights on the Metro. We have every intention of going into the Metro. It will be pick-based, but I wouldn't overread into any specific timing on when you think we're going to get a product to market.OperatorOur next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham. Looks like we're going to have Michael Genovese from MKM Partners.Michael Genovese - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionOkay, great. I wanted to follow up on the last question. Just about your participation and how we should think about your participation in the coherent Metro 100G-and-above market going forward. So it sounds like what you're saying is you planned something in that market, but it's in product development at this stage? Any more color there?David F. WelchSure. Let me see if I can answer that a little bit. First off, DTN-X is a high-capacity system whether it's Metro or Long Haul. We sell a lot of DTN-X into Metro applications today, and our customers are very happy with that application. The question, really, for us in the Metro is: For the lesser-capacity Metro applications, what complementary boxes do we need to make available to our customers? We've been involved in technology development for the past year, and that technology development is on track, as Tom indicated. In the appropriate time, we'll roll out what we want to say about product launches. But now is not that time. We view it as a market that we will get into, and we believe that we can deliver the customer satisfaction that we have in the long haul into the Metro space. So we think that will bode -- play well for us when we get the right product in there.Michael Genovese - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionOkay. When we look at the third quarter and the visibility that you had going into the third quarter, and the third quarter revenues turned out to be strong, and it looked like it was the mix you were looking for, primarily, or even a little bit better in the way it impacted gross margins, but how many kind of customers gave you that particularly -- had that particularly high channel sale? I mean, just roughly, was it in a hand -- a small handful of customers, kind of providing that sense of visibility and that added to the third quarter? And that's just not there -- that's got a different mix in the fourth quarter?Ita M. BrennanYes. I mean, we had a couple of -- so we obviously had the ones that we talked about, specifically, where we had a strong mix of -- because they weren't deploying the amplifiers and stuff, right. And then -- but then we also had a couple of other deployments where -- that they took a higher fill level as part of the initial deployment than we might have anticipated, right. And that's -- that will fluctuate. If you look at Q4, we have some fairly significant deployments where their initial fill level is lower, right. And that's really the dynamic, right, between any large deployment that can be in the $5 million to $10 million range and has that kind of change in mix is going to have an impact on margins, right. Either way, the fill will come. It's just a question of whether you get it kind of initially or it comes out the network, starts to be used, right.Michael Genovese - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionBut I mean, do you have any sense just roughly speaking that with the customers who took the higher channel sale in 3Q -- kind of any rough sense of how long it will be? How many kind of quarters of demand they started with before they come back with more channel fill demand?Ita M. BrennanI mean, obviously, it's going to vary by customer. But nobody is buying fill upfront and paying for it unless they think they're going to use it in a reasonable timeframe, right. I mean, we've seen -- and it's been good news to see people coming back and adding fill to networks kind of inside 12 months. So I would look at the customers that took that extra or additional filler taking it because they think that they're going to use it, certainly, inside 12 months.Thomas J. FallonOur lead times on the fill -- it's 2 to 3 weeks. So this is not I got to buy a bunch and put it in my warehouse in case I create demand. They can typically win circuits in the market and buy from us and get it deployed without having inventory. So I don't anticipate, as Ita said, that they're stockpiling inventory.Michael Genovese - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionAnd then just last question. I mean, we -- would you just generally expect, I mean, without giving any particular quarter here, guidance like -- but would you predict -- expect to be adding kind of a mid-single-digit number of DTN-X customers on average? Do you feel like that, that's sustainable?Thomas J. FallonI think we've been adding 4 to 5 a quarter, and we're continuing those. What's interesting to me is we continue to, on average, add 3 DTN customers a quarter over the last year. And that product has been out in the market for -- since 2005. So I certainly anticipate we'll be adding some number of like we've been 4 to 6 each quarter. Some quarters might be more. Some quarters might be less. But on average, I would say that's not our unreasonable expectation.David F. WelchJust in general, only about a little over a third of our customers buying the DTN-X today. So there's quite a few number of customers to convert. And in general, about 40% of our DTN-X customers are new. So beyond that, I think there's quite a bit of -- and as Tom indicated, we have a strong RFP pipeline. On that, we expect to see a substantive growth and be able to grow faster to market, and that's because of the expansion of that product line.OperatorOur next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham.Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionI got a couple of questions for you. And actually, right on the subject that you were just talking about. So you made a comment that 40% of your DTN-X customers are new. Is that a similar weighting in terms of the amount of backlog that you've got. I would assume that the majority of the newer customers take longer, probably to put in and get acceptance out since your existing customers can accept very quickly. So as I look into what you're looking at into the next several 2, 3 quarters is the mix more towards new customers than old customers in the way you see the revenue pulling?Ita M. BrennanYes. I mean, that's -- I'm not sure on a dollar basis that, that would be true, right. I think we've still got a lot of existing customers that will drive significant dollars, right. In terms of looking at numbers of customers, I think it's fair to say that we will -- we expect to see, and we are seeing, a fair representation of new customers and kind of adding revenues and adding incremental, additional revenues or new revenues to the pipeline. Right? I think if you look -- we've got 4 customers that we haven't invoiced on your DTN-X purchase commitments, and the bulk of those are new, right. So that gives you some idea for kind of where the length of deployment to revenue is on some of the new stuff, right?Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionCan you give us a sense of how long that typically goes for new customers these days? Is it typically 2 or 3 quarters? Or is it less?Ita M. BrennanIt very much depends on the customers. It's probably at least a quarter if it's a completely new customer, and mostly 2 and in certain cases, it might be 3. But 3 would be kind of unusual, right.Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionSimilars, if you could help us out a little bit. Similar kind of discussion between domestic and international, are you seeing a shift towards more international? Again, trying to understand the timeline for closing and recognizing revenues, as well as the implications for costs because I would assume that there's a lot more installation internationally and support internationally, which is fairly expensive compared to domestic support.Ita M. BrennanYes. I mean, I think you saw this quarter in the U.S. is very strong, right, because we had a number of large customers in the U.S. that drove significant revenue. So your U.S. mix was actually strong this quarter. But I think as a generic statement, we are seeing a lot more international business and international activities. And we would expect to see that shift continue. And in Q4, if you look at my comments around service projects and stuff that we expect to see a good, healthy international mix in Q4 as well.Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionSo that shift to international is a big piece of the spreading out of the timeline of recognition of revenue then?Ita M. BrennanYes. It will contribute. Some of that will definitely contribute to it taking longer. But if it's a large international customer that we have not done business with before, then the booked revenue cycle is longer than if it was something in the U.S., for sure. Yes.Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionAnother question. There's been a fair number of a announcements out of AWS around the Equinix, and Level 3 talking about cloud-to-cloud. And obviously, I don't want to ask you a direct question on any particular customer here. But can you talk a little bit about how much cloud-to-cloud is a driver of your business? When you say you have 2 10% customers that are in the Internet, are those cloud-to-cloud related? Or are those access-oriented content delivery networks? What should we be thinking about in terms of the cloud footprint as a driver?David F. WelchI think what you're seeing is there's growth across-the-board, is the right thing [ph]. Our -- we see -- do a lot of data center-to-data center types of interconnects. We do a lot of distribution networks interconnect, and we are seeing -- we've talked about data center markets, the MSO markets, the carrier markets. All of them are doing well. We see both growth internationally, and in North America from a market share perspective in both -- but I don't think the weighting of one over the other is frankly changing that much. You're just seeing strong growth out of -- across-the-board.OperatorOur next question comes from Sanjiv Wadhwani from Stifel.Mike Lin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research DivisionThis is Mike Lin, speaking on behalf of Sanjiv. I just wanted to follow up on the gross margins. Your target for gross margins was 45% in 2014. And I was just trying to get a sense of how much of that improvement is under your control and how much of that was depending on mix.Ita M. BrennanOkay. So the -- I mean, the 45% target margin is part of our midterm business model. And we -- if you look at the discussion in my remarks, it's -- we don't see that as being something that we achieve as we work through 2014 in an environment where we're adding some of these strategic customers that we talked about, right. So I think we see it very much as 2014 as the year, where we are continuing to add strategic accounts and strategic footprints. And in that scenario, the margins -- I think what we saw with our Q4 guidance, is we believe we can keep margins in that 40% or above range. But I wouldn't expect to see them expand out towards the 45% on a consistent basis until we're putting fill into these networks that we're deploying now.Mike Lin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research DivisionOkay. And regarding visibility, the topline in 2014, you've given indications that in the intermediate term, you feel like you have pretty good visibility. But do you have a sense of what you think growth will be for 2014 overall?Ita M. BrennanYes. I mean, other than saying that we really believe we can take share, right, we haven't really commented on 2014 revenue number beyond that. I mean, we do believe from what we're seeing that we are adding new customers and taking market share. But we'll have to get more granular on that as we move through next year.Mike Lin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research DivisionOkay. And how would you characterize the pipeline and your activity as -- would you comment it as accelerating versus the past quarter or 2?Thomas J. FallonWell, I think the RFP activity as in the number of different RFPs that would come into the house as strong and stable over the last couple of quarters. And when it called -- accelerating, I think a lot of networks are making conversions over to 100-gig technologies. When we got into the market and it's called beginning in Q3 of last year, the market started really -- started to turn at that point and really had some acceleration in that process in the first half of the year and I think we continue to see that conversion going on. But it's at a steady clip.Thomas J. FallonI'll add that the pace of the RFP, and I agree with Dave, is roughly the same. I think one of the differences is we're seeing a couple of these deals be more strategic and larger than the average deal.Operator[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Rod Hall with JPMorgan.Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionTom, I just had a couple. I wanted to see -- I guess, kind of understand what's going on with current business trends. Although [ph] Tom, I don't think I've ever heard of median-term visibility in telecom equipment. So that's a new one.Thomas J. FallonTrying to set a new benchmark to see if anybody'll follow my lead on this. I'll even look smarter than you, but we'll see.Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionExactly. You found a new vein of optimism there. But anyway, I wanted to check and see. Cisco's come out and said that they're going to add long-range optics to their routing platforms, which -- I don't know, it doesn't strike me as that serious of a threat. But I just wondered if you could comment on that strategically. Do you think that as you talk to people -- you think there's any interest in that, you think it could be a new kind of competitive threat in optical? And then I just wondered -- I don't -- you guys may have said this at the beginning of the call so I -- I missed the first part of the call. But can you update us on the CFO search? And are you -- what's your plan there? And when do you think you'll have a new CFO on board? That's all.Thomas J. FallonSure. I'll start with the CFO. That's more straightforward. We have not started the search yet. I anticipate I will start to launch an official search this week, and I anticipate that the goal, certainly, is to have a CFO on board during Ita's tenure here through the end of February. And I think that's a reasonable target. So that's that one I think. In regard to Cisco putting long-reach optics onto their platform, I'll make a couple of comments and then I'll ask Dave to complete them. One, I think that this is a continuation of the strategy to sell more routers. And anything you can do to sell more routers is a right, what they want to do. And we and the rest of the industry is working very hard to show what the value proposition of an intelligent optical network is. And that means that you need less routers to perform the transport function in the core of the network. I don't certainly felt their strategy for saying that the router can do this. My view is there are technical limitations, particularly around power and space in that. Second of all, I just have a fundamental question is: Why would you put transport technology into the highest cost port platform and the least reliable port platform in the network, when the most reliable port network is at the transport layer and the most value-add pricing proposal is the transport layer? So I understand why they're doing it. I think that -- I personally believe it's going to have a hard time creating much traction and it's a response to, I think, a threat that the transport industry is bringing to the router industry. Dave?David F. WelchSo I'll add on a couple of thoughts here. It's been our position as always, as architectural position, has always been IT over OTN, which is the Intelligent Transport Network. The concept of IP over DWDM has been a philosophy. It's been talked about for quite a while, half a dozen years or more probably. It never stuck. But sad to say, and we've mentioned this in our call, is that they go out to the surveys, they go out to service providers. 90% of them claim that they will convert their networks to IP over OTN in the coming years. But why is that? The primary cost that they're trying to pull out of network is the burden of the space, power and cost of the IP transit traffic through routers. And IP over OTN or an Intelligent Transport Network reduces that cost. So putting DWDM ports onto a router isn't helping out on the space, power, cost structure of the overall network whereas IP over an OTN or an Intelligent Transport Network satisfies the overall network cost savings. In order to drive a total network cost, layer 0 to layer 3, going down, a good chunk of it is going to come from redistributing how you managed the network from a -- how you manage the packet traffic through these switch structures with inside the network. And it's going to be over OTN in the near term.Thomas J. FallonThank you for joining us this afternoon, and thanks for your questions. We look forward to updating you on our continuing progress. Have a great day.OperatorThat concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time.")
# 2013 q4
infn.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question is going to come from George"
            " Notter with Jefferies. Your line is now open.George Notter - JefferiesI guess I want to know if anything has really changed in terms of your visibility looking forward. You made a number of comments, I think, in the monologue about optimism around the short, intermediate and long-term. I think if I go back to last quarter you made comments about confidence in the intermediate term. I guess I am just trying to figure out if anything has really changed here in terms of your visibility and the outlook at all and if you could kind of walk us through that, that would be great. Thanks.Thomas FallonSure. The big change is, George, last time I was feeling comfortable with the intermediate term and now I remain comfortable with the short, intermediate and long term. And quite frankly the intermediate term, we have said was kind of a two to four quarter outlook, we went out [ph] eaten into that window. What we had anticipated is actually coming to fruition. The conversations that we had with our customers late in the year have turned into build plans and POs. And we feel two things, I think comfortable certainly with Q1. As Ita said, our industry is typically down about 18% quarter-on-quarter to Q1 over Q4. So we are actually guiding to an up quarter in Q1 and that’s pretty unusual for us and the industry.And this has, I don’t think it's a one quarter play. I see fundamental demand from a number of our customers that I feel very comfortable about the first half of the year. And I also feel about the longer term. I still believe as I stated in the call, this is a multiyear upgrade in technology cycle. I think reports I have recently read said, it continues to grow at least through 2018, and I suspect that’s a little conservative. We also have a very robust pipeline of new products that I feel good about.So I am overall pretty comfortable and confident with where we sit both from an industry perspective and our position within that industry.George Notter - JefferiesGot you. And then the other one I wanted to ask was just on, your development on PIC chips. You said something in the monologue that I think I missed. Could you just repeat what you said? Perhaps it was development of 1 terabit chip or a Metro chip, I cannot remember.Thomas FallonYes. And if you remember at the beginning of last year we stated we would -- one of our deliverables would be a PIC that was designated for specific use within a metro platform, not just a metro platform but would be used in our metro platform. Would be delivered full working prototypes or pilot units will be delivered to system engineering by Q4. And it was a reflection that we did indeed do that. We also reflected, and I think this is important, it is one major milestone but it's only a major milestone and a series of major milestones on our way for us to deliver a differentiated, high-capacity metro solution. So don’t over read and estimate when we will have a metro product out there. We will make product announcements at the appropriate time but we continue to make progress on a lot of technology fronts and that’s an important one for us.George Notter - JefferiesGot you. And then can you remind us where you guys are in terms of 1 terabit capability on the PIC side?Thomas FallonWe have demonstrated it. We have not made any further announcements in regard to that. And I think that certainly the PIC has the capabilities of going 1 terabit, 2 terabit, probably more than that. We believe that it is uniquely capable of doing that in an economic fashion. And we will bring that to market when we think that it is appropriate for the market at the time. Coming to market I think, we still get some people saying 500-gig on a LAN card is too much, which is funny. We will bring that to market when we think it's the right time to bring that to market and it's the appropriate priority for our R&D dollars.OperatorOur next question will come from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Our next question will come from Daniel Martins with FBR. Your line is now open.Scott Thompson - FBR Capital MarketsThis is actually Scott Thompson. I dialed in remotely. I wanted to ask you a question about the metro opportunity. I am starting to hear a little bit of chatter on the industry edges about a lot of traffic staying in the metro and how that may impact the longer haul 100-gig. Can you guys help set our expectations on what they expect around metro, I guess, not only in the first half but more in the second half and how it might impact the long haul. Thanks.David WelchYes. I will try and answer that. This is David Welch. In a couple of areas on what the market directions are and then how we plan to address that. There is a couple of questions in there. First question is, when does the metro market, is it ready for 100-gig deployment in volume. We think that that is something that’s probably closer into the late '15, '16 type of timeframe, when 100-gig becomes a dominant player in the metro space. So as people -- there has always been historically a variation of cashing if you will, or content, stays in the metro or it gets moved around the long-haul. We don’t see any real change in strategies there. The only difference between now and the older networks is you do have an overlay of large nationwide networks of data centers to deal with and integrate.The volume on the long-haul market from all of our customers continues to grow consistent with what they have told us in the years past. And we have seen a slowdown in the volume of data in the long-haul. For Infinera's play in the metro, we do supply our current product for high capacity metros and we are deployed in high capacity metros today. What we will continue to do is build out our capabilities in our feature set in order to impact that, and we should be in a good position to impact that as 100-gig becomes a strong player within the metro space. 100-gig will be a significant player in the metro space in the late '15 beginning '16 type of timeframe.OperatorOur next question will come from Mike Genovese with MKM Partners. Your line is now open.Michael Genovese - MKM PartnersYour 1Q guidance is up 12% year-over-year at the midpoint. Does that seem like a good target or is there reasons to think as it moves through the year that that would accelerate or decelerate.Ita BrennanYes. Obviously, Mike, we have guided Q1 and then put some guard rails around what we think for the year, right. I think what we have seen for Q1 this year is obviously a little different from what we have seen historically. We have got pretty good visibility from customers into what they plan to do certainly in the first half of the year. And people are certainly laying out plans around the 100-gig and 100-gig deployments. I think that’s a vastly better place than where we passed there at this time last year in terms of just visibility to what was happening. You know in terms of what happens through the rest of the year, we are at this point not kind of laying out a quarterly view of that.Michael Genovese - MKM PartnersAll right.Thomas FallonWe want to say, if I looked at what I see in our space, any number of people that we compete with in some way, shape or form, missed their number for Q4 and reflected that they are going to have a tougher Q1. I am personally pretty optimistic about the robust demand that we see both for Q4 that was a good quarter, a very good quarter, and for Q1 which I think having an up quarter off of Q4s, outstanding.Michael Genovese - MKM PartnersYes. And I want to congratulate on a good year and a good 1Q outlook. On the gross margins, you guys gave us some full year information, saying remaining in the low 40s. Do you think that -- so you came in at about 41% this year, do you think that we can be up year-over-year? And then beyond that question, how long can this process of filling channel card take? And should we think about gross margins being significantly better in 2015 or could it be 2016 before we see something like that?Ita BrennanYes. I think we have been pretty consistent in saying that for 2014 the most important metrics is still around growing share, taking footprints, right. And that’s why we are kind of sticking to our view that margins for '14 will be in the low 40s as we move through that, right. We are starting to see fill into some of the earlier DTN-X networks that we deployed and we are seeing customers coming back and adding capacity into those networks. So I would expect that you will see that kind of expansion of gross margin as you move through, into '15 and you start to balance out that mix. I mean if we think about to Q3 and the margin expansion that we saw there with some product mix shifts. So clearly that does drive the gross margin. It's more a matter of when are you going to be shifting from footprint wins to adding capacity into those networks.Thomas FallonAnd I would reiterate, the most important thing for us to do right now is gain footprint, win customers and grow our market share. Every platform, every network that we want to franchise on, we will have the opportunity to fill that network for a decade. It's a great opportunity for us to be able to take advantage of this growing market, our leadership in the market. And to be able to do that with very very low margin, common equipment and still maintain in the 40s, I am pretty delighted with that. And quite frankly, if margin goes up a lot more than that, it's probably because we are not winning enough footprint.Michael Genovese - MKM PartnersRight. Final clarification, quickly. Do you classify Rostelecom as a tier 1 carrier?Thomas FallonYes, we do. We are deployed in the regulated portion of their business in Moscow. So that is -- we kind of view it as a, is it a regulated business, a PTT, and that qualifies within that, yes.OperatorOur next question will come from Alex Henderson with Needham & Company.Alexander Henderson - Needham & CompanyI wanted to follow up on Mike's good question there on the gross margins, just to pin down the mechanics here. Just to be clear, the continuation of the low 40s gross margin is not a function of a change in pricing conditions or of increased competition or alternation of pricing dynamics but rather it's strictly a function of the mix of customers' installations. Is that correct?Thomas FallonYes. Mostly mix not of customers but a mix of product. Now we sell kind of three products. We sell an optical amplification layer. Now that carries very very low margin. And we sell commons that includes sheet metal and some common equipment that carries fairly low margin. And we sell the fill, which carries good margin. So really it's a matter of product mix. When you win a new customer, when you build a new network, you are putting an optical infrastructure that will last for the lifetime of the fill of that fiber. That’s an expensive proposition but you get the opportunity to reap the benefit of that for a very long time. And we are in a position where [indiscernible] 40 plus points of margin. We are creating cash, growing market share. I am pretty happy with that position and I am going to be willing to grow market share under those conditions for us as fast and as long as we can.Ita BrennanYes. And I think Alex, if you look at the pricing data that’s coming out of the industry analysts, some of them, it's pretty much what you would expect to see, right. I mean it's in that 15% plus or minus decline. We anticipate those in our plan and we need to drive cost reductions that offset those. That’s not new for this business. So that’s all kind of build into that view f the world from a gross margin perspective.Alexander Henderson - Needham & CompanyPart of the reason why I asked the question in that format is that the, obviously the events that were widely discussed over the last month or so relative to tier 1 in the U.S. combined with announcement of a win at TeliaSonera [ph] by a competitor that we would not have considered competitive with you guys, does raise the question if there is some desperation pricing going on out there or any type of discontinuity or disenfranchisement that might alter the pricing environment. So you haven't seen any of that?Thomas FallonI think in aggregate the pricing environment is pretty normalized. We are probably seeing, as Ita mentioned, about 15% reduction. Having said that, on any given day with any given customer, it could be critically important to a supplier to not lose that opportunity, you know the difference with must win and can't lose. And I think it's the can't lose customer you will see behaviors that are at times, I think, irrational. We see some of that without question. We try to act rationally in all of our transactions. Though I am suspecting we would be accused of acting irrationally also. But I think that it is a fairly normalized environment. I think the competitive landscape is getting better not worse in general. I think there are a clear differentiation between innovators, commoditizers and those that are trying to, quite frankly, stay in business. And I feel very comfortable with our position of both for winning market share and building a healthy profitable business over time.Alexander Henderson - Needham & CompanyOkay. One last question and then I will cede the floor. The comment about urgency from your customers and urgency on installation, is that indication of an acceleration in RFP activity, RFI activity or is just a symptom of a couple of your specific customers? Is that a broader phenomena?Ita BrennanNo, I think it's across both of those, right. We are definitely seeing RFI activities with accounts that we don’t do business with yet and also with our own customers. You know laying out plans that are more comprehensive because obviously this is a significant upgrade cycle for them.OperatorOur next question will come from Rod Hall with JPMC. Your line is now open.Roderick Hall - JP Morgan ChaseI just wanted to -- thanks for the questions by the way, I just wanted to ask you, I guess a specific and general question on the [indiscernible] speculation about the tier 1 deal. And I guess the first question is more broad, though and that is, we as analyst we always tend to look for keys under the street light in the night but there's a lot of other places we could be looking for the keys. And because we've got the deal we've all been focused on so much, there's been a lot happening in optical around the world really, not just in the U.S. I just wonder if you could comment on how material that deal is or isn't to the overall picture as you see it now. I know that back when we started talking about it, maybe it might have looked more material than it does now. I just wondered how things have moved on and how it looks opposed against the rest of your business opportunities and then I have a follow-up to that.Thomas FallonWell, I am not going to talk about the specific deal. We signed a non-disclosure agreement that says we won't discuss that deal for a long period of time. I am going to talk about what I consider important macros in the world. I have long said that where the industry continues to move from a capacity perspective, who is building the biggest networks, who is putting in the most capacity, the buck has moved. Today it is the internet content providers, it's the wholesalers, cable people are putting in gigantic amounts of capacity. And we are extraordinarily well positioned in those spaces that are grow extraordinarily quickly. That’s not to state that the tier 1 market isn't relevant to us. It is relevant to us. And as I stated on the call, we are up to having 15 tier one customers. Some of those are relatively large size, some of those are relatively young and have the opportunity to grow.We are going to continue to go after every place in the market but I don’t believe that our success hinges on any one or two customers. The market is growing rapidly. The 100-gig market is growing extraordinarily rapidly. We are exceptionally well positioned in that and it's going to be, I think, in a very long, healthy cycle. And we are going to grow where that customer base values our simplicity, our quality, our ease of use, our time as a weapon, all the attributes that we bring to that market. And we are going to go after everybody, we are going to win some, we are going to win a lot and we are going to lose a few. And I feel very comfortable about our outlook.Roderick Hall - JP Morgan ChaseCan I just follow up on one comment you made there, Tom. You say you have a NDA, that makes sense. Are you NDAd indefinitely or if you lose the deal, can you not talk about it still, or can you talk about it once it's over? Just to understand exactly how that falls [ph]?Thomas FallonFor three years, I believe is the term, and I am going to honor that NDA.Roderick Hall - JP Morgan ChaseOkay. Okay. Just one more question and then I will cede the floor. Can you talk a little bit about what's going on in international distribution. I know that was a topic of conversation last quarter. Give us an update on where you are at with that. Maybe, I don’t know if you said anything earlier about the regional split of the new customers, can you give us any idea with that looks like?Thomas FallonIn Q4 I think our overall international business was 46%. So we are continuing to grow our international presence. And we are doing that both with a direct approach but we are also using a channel partner strategy, so with our channel strategy. We have had a couple of channel relationships, partners this last year that have made really, really great progress. We have announced a number of key wins that we won with these channel partners. Channels represented about 8% of our revenue last year and 12% in Q4. We are going to continue to use these partners to go into places of the world that on our own we either don’t have yet the relationships or there is too much a necessity of having a local presence. And we are going to find the best partners in the world. We are going to go and use them to sell our product. We have got, I guess, some very good relationships, so we started this initiative a couple of years ago and I think that it's really beginning to bear fruit and we anticipate continuing this channel program, investing more in it and growing it over time.OperatorOur next question will come from Dmitry Netis with William Blair & Company. Your line is now open.Dmitry Netis - William Blair & CompanySo hate to take the dust off of last quarter's record but if you could just tell us how much of the slippage last quarter is causing this tough side in Q1 outlook.Thomas FallonWell, I am going to take issue with what you call slippage. We very specifically try to guide for the quarter with the opportunity that we see. We said very clearly on the call last time that we saw probably no end of the year budget flush. I think we were correct in comparison to what a lot of people in the industry saw. So I would not consider it slippage, I consider it Q4 was Q4, Q1 in the first half of this year or Q1 in the first half of this year.Dmitry Netis - William Blair & CompanyOkay. I saw that you had some billing acceptance issues on a couple of purchase orders which didn’t come in, I think for which you said you would expect to see in Q1?Ita BrennanNo, I think our commentary, if we kind of go back to that, was more given the spending levels that we had seen through the year, we didn’t think that it was necessary to go on a big budget left on table that would cause a budget flush. And the follow on to that had been, you know we thought people were very interested in getting builds in place right out of the shoot of the beginning of '14. That’s pretty much what we had seen. It's a bit of an academic argument to try to parse it apart the way you are. I think really what we are seeing is people have upped their budgets, they have upped their budgets fairly quickly for a Q1 and they are starting to spend money.Thomas FallonWhat Ita did make a comment on and maybe this is what you are referencing, the midpoint of our guidance last quarter was 135, we came in at 139. And she said that the overhead was a little bit because some deals that we didn’t know if they would close in Q4, actually did close in Q4. Customers gave us acceptance of those networks because they won't determine live, which I think is great news.Dmitry Netis - William Blair & CompanyVery good. I appreciate that color. I think that’s exactly what I was referring to. But it's good to see intrinsic growth from existing and new customers transpiring here in the first half.Thomas FallonI agree. There is nothing like our customers' customers demanding more internet capacity.Dmitry Netis - William Blair & CompanyGreat. And then the second question also on the, kind of GO splits, and I know we have talked quite a bit on that already. But clearly you are seeing a good traction in EMEA, APAC. You have noted last quarter I believe as well, that you see a lot more opportunity in North America over the next 12 months. And so now excluding this tier 1, what's left in North America? Are we still -- are there pockets of opportunities you think you will win? I mean if you give us an update on North America specially, given that December quarter was a little weak in terms of your sales in that region.Thomas FallonI won't go to the, it was weak in Q4, but I will talk about how it's going to be moving forward. CenturyLink, as we said, has had a very strong quarter with us. I anticipate we are going to have lot of opportunity with CenturyLink moving forward. I stated and I am surprised nobody has asked questions on it, that we won a significant North America wholesaler in Q1 that’s been a long term customer. I think that’s going to drive a significant portion of business moving forward. I said we had four of the top cable providers, that certainly leads number one of them to go get, and we are going to go after that. I said we had three of the top four internet content providers, that leaves one of those to go after.So if you don’t think we are hungry, you don’t know us. We are going to after all of them. We are going to grow our business. We are going to win market share and we are going to take advantage of our position in this market.Dmitry Netis - William Blair & CompanyOkay. And then on Level 3, I mean that’s been always your marquee customer over a number of years. Is that a 2014 opportunity? I think it was going to be decided in terms of 100G play there in the first half.Thomas FallonI would replay what I just told you, which is we won a large North America wholesaler who has been a long-term customer of ours.Dmitry Netis - William Blair & CompanyOkay. Very well, thank you for that. And then just maybe last thing on the submarine deals you guys were winning. Are these competitive bids that you are taking share from someone else? And who exactly are you taking share from in those submarine Asia Pac deals?Thomas FallonYes. The submarine market is extraordinarily competitive now. Not everybody can play because there is a technology limitation and you have to have cutting edge technology, but they are hyper-competitive. And each one of those we won, it was won, highly competed for, and one in particular we said we displaced an incumbent. So assume every time we win a submarine deal, it's because we won it. Both from a technology perspective, a value perspective, which includes price, service and support perspective, the whole deal. And I think that we are going to have a lot of opportunity in submarine moving forward. Our SD FEC is a huge gap closure in a performance issue that we did have and we don’t have that anymore.OperatorOur next question will come from Subu Subrahmanyan with Juda Group. Your line is now open.Subu Subrahmanyan - The Juda GroupTom, I wanted to ask again about the trajectory you saw existing fourth quarter, some business actually getting pulled in, and then first quarter being stronger than normal. When you look at it, is there any particular trend line to it, geographically, customer type wise. And when you look at it, how much of this is just timing of a couple of deals versus something more fundamental happening the way you see it.Thomas FallonWell, first I want to clarify, we did not pull business into Q4. We had some very, very big and complicated submarine deals in Q4. And in submarine deals you have to install it, you have to turn it over, and they have got to run traffic on it until they accept it. And the acceptance was always going to be borderline, kind of Q4-Q1. And to our great pleasure, the installs went well. The acceptance went well and they wanted to turn it on, our customers wanted to turn their network on and start carrying live revenue revenue generating traffic. That’s why we were at the very high-end of our guide. I wouldn’t consider it pulling it in, I would say that things lined up well. And usually if you have ten things that can happen and not all of them do, you know most of them happened this time.In Q1, I am going to ask Ita to give more flavor on where it's coming from. But we are seeing fairly strong demand across the board but I would say a little distributed towards North America in Q1.Ita BrennanBut again it's a combination of customers, existing customers, just kind of truing up for their deployment for '14, and then there is also some new customers in there as well that were starting to ramp some volume with, right. That we would see kind of ramp as we move into the year.Subu Subrahmanyan - The Juda GroupSure. Then I had a follow-up, on the 100-gig builds in general, are you seeing the broadening in North America, do you expect international to be a bigger percentage of revenue in 2014? And is that part of what's impacting gross margin as you think about it?Thomas FallonI don’t think international -- I mean in Q4 it was 46%. I think that’s at the very high end of my guess. I would believe that over time a healthy mix of international is probably 40% to 45%, in that range. And I think that I would be comfortable with that expectation. But that means we have to grow, continue to grow our international business but we will grow North America best.Ita BrennanYes. And in terms of the gross margins part of that, Subu, I mean by far a bigger driver is going to be product mix etcetera than it is actually between the different geographies.Operator(Operator Instructions) We will take another question from Daniel Martins with FBR. Your line is now open.Scott Thompson - FBR Capital MarketsHi, guys, Scott circling back. A couple of quick ideas here. One is, you talked about having three of the four top content service providers. What do you expect of those guys this year? I mean they seem to be growing CapEx investment, network investment at a pretty brisk pace. Are they sneaking up on some of the larger tier 2, tier 1 players at this point as a group, or will it take another year or two before they get there. Secondly, the seasonality and the early, maybe early start to optical deployments in '14. Do you think that’s more of an industry thing or is it more of a, it's your specific thing? Thank you.Thomas FallonWell, with regard to internet content providers, I don’t know how their networking CapEx spend compares to tier 1s and tier 2s. I can tell you that they are building big networks, they are building big long-haul networks, they are building big metro networks. I see, when I talk to them, no slowdown in the growth of internet traffic that they are experiencing. I continue to see them being very committed for making sure that they have the capacity necessary to growth their businesses. So I think that how it compares to other tiers of industry, I don’t know. All I know is it's a very healthy business. It's a growing business and we are well positioned.In regard to seasonality, once again I can't -- we are peer play, optical DWDM company. I can't talk to how various companies CapEx are going in various. As far as my view on CapEx, here is want I think about CapEx. I think that one, the CapEx they spend with us is going to grow. Two, the CapEx they spend on legacy technologies is going to shrink. How that balances out on overall CapEx, I don’t know, but there is no fundamental slowdown in the capacity that I see our customers wanting to put in place in the short and medium term.Scott Thompson - FBR Capital MarketsOkay. And then as a follow-up to that. You mentioned in your comments early in the call about some stabilization around competition and things that might be stabilizing factors for margins. Can you expand on that a little bit and when we might be able to see potentially a bit of relief in gross margins, anything there?Thomas FallonWell, as Ita pointed out, I mean the relief in gross margins mostly comes as we start getting more fill than we get new footprint. And I hope that that balance doesn’t happen for a while. I like the balance we are at right now where we are winning lots and lots of footprint with reasonable amounts of fill so that we are creating the opportunity for an annuity that is margin rich. I think that what I see in the market, I mean clearly, Nokia, Siemens went away, [indiscernible] I applaud those guys courage into both trying to build this into an independent enterprise. I think that they have got a lot of work cut out for them. And I am not a believer that private equity companies are going to go into this, because they just lose a lot of money upfront getting a lot of footprint so we could make money later. Maybe I am naïve but that’s my view. I think that [indiscernible] quite frankly, is doing well and I think that they have a good technology. I continue to believe that it's going to be more a two vendor world then the eight or nine vendor world it's been. And I think we are well positioned as a [indiscernible] to be the leaders in that market. I think that some of the large multinationals, you could only so much money in this business for so long before you have to take a step back and say what are we going to do differently. And I see that occurring and playing out over the next year. So I feel very comfortable that the industry while still over competitive, is in a beginning phases of getting better.OperatorAnd I am showing we have no further questions.Thomas FallonWell, thank you for joining us this afternoon and for your questions. I would like to thank Ita for her many contributions to the company and I wish her the best in her new adventure. I am also delighted to welcome Brad as we enter this new phase of our company's journey. We look forward to updating on our progress in the future. Have a great day.OperatorAnd with that we will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.")
# 2014 q1
infn.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you. Now we will begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator"
            " Instructions). Our first question comes from Sanjiv Wadhwani with Stifel. Your line is now open.Sanjiv Wadhwani - StifelThanks so much. Sorry, I joined the call little bit later. This question might have been already answered. But if you look at the wholesaler which you talked about in the last earnings call and I think in the last upgrade cycle that went through an investment of I think $450 million or so. Now the cost for bid has come down. I'm just curious to see in this current 100 gig upgrade cycle. What are you expectations from them going forward?And then second question I had was lot of investments being made by Web 2.0 guys like Google, if you could talk about the exposure to that market and what are you seeing in that market in terms of growth that would be helpful too? Thanks so much.Brad FellerSure. First in regard to the bandwidth wholesaler, you missed that, that I did say it was level three. We have got permission to….Sanjiv Wadhwani - StifelOkay. Sorry.Brad FellerI don’t think it was a big surprise for anybody.Sanjiv Wadhwani - StifelNo, no but I don't want to take the name and get (inaudible) want to talk about it in terms of names.Brad FellerYes. So they have been a very substantive part of our business in the past, they have been a long-term partner of ours and they now reselected to go to market with a 100 gig. That revenue started in Q1 and we anticipate it ramping over the next several years. I'm not going to quantify the size of the deal, I think they -- and appreciate that. But, if you look at level 3's business model, they drive to be the largest provider of ways in the world and provide them at the lowest dollar per bit.So they put in substantive amount of capacity and they are making very large investment decisions. And I think we're in a very good position to take advantage of a lot of that capital expenditure.In regard to Web 2.0 we have, we are in three of the top four, it's been a market that we have long been in, we have a very good relationship with most of the major providers. And they generally are making fairly substantive investments currently and we are participating in a good part of that. And I do think as I commented here for many number of quarters now, I still believe that the industry focus is too much on the top two Tier 1s in the country, which is where CapEx was historically and doesn’t focus on that front, internet content or ICP are Web 2.0 people which is where I think most of CapEx is going to be in the future and I think we are extraordinarily well placed in that fair market.Sanjiv Wadhwani - StifelGot it. Thanks so much. And great quarter guys.Tom FallonThank you.Brad FellerThanks.OperatorOur next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.Simona Jankowski - Goldman SachsHi, thank you. I just wanted to ask you about your 21% customer, if I heard that correctly. I don’t think you’ve had customer over 20% for quite a few quarters or it’s in years. Could you just comment a little bit and (inaudible) as you mentioned the Tier 1 in the U.S. and then the cable operator, could you just give a little more color on the lumpiness of that. Is that kind of big one time lump for some reason or what is the sustainability of that kind of revenue with that one customer?Brad FellerYes. So Simona, I don’t think we said 21%, we said we had two customers that represented over 10% of our revenues for the quarter; one of those being a cable operator and the other being a North American Tier 1 service provider. We have strong business with them; historically we expect to continue that strong business with them. So it’s not a one-time kind of phenomenon.Simona Jankowski - Goldman SachsSo just to be clear, so in the press release where it says that the largest customer percent is 21% was that supposed to say largest customers combined?Tom Fallon(Inaudible).Simona Jankowski - Goldman SachsOkay. So, the 21% is combined for those two together?Tom FallonYou can look at the press release and see what we did.Simona Jankowski - Goldman SachsOkay. Thank you very much.OperatorOur next question comes from George Notter with Jefferies. Your line is now open.George Notter - JefferiesHey, thanks very much guys. I guess I wanted to ask about the guidance for Q2, the $160 million to $170 million in sales that’s a fair amount higher than certainly we were expecting. Can you talk about what’s driving that, it sounds like it’s one single customer opportunity. Can you tell us any more about that deployment, is it indeed a one quarter build, is it multiple quarters. I guess it kind of puts us in a tough spot in terms of kind of modeling out the company beyond Q2. So, I’d love to get any more kind of sense for how that build rolls out that would be great?And then also on Q2, why wouldn’t the gross margin be lower in Q2 just given what seems to be a really big footprint build here? Thanks a lot.Tom FallonSo George, two comments. One, it is not driven by one order. We are seeing really good demand in general, a lot skewed towards North America, but we are seeing strong demand from cable, we are seeing strong demand from internet content or Web 2.0 people, we are seeing demand from Tier 1s around the world. And on top of that, we did have a large opportunity that came in, but the base fundamental business is very strong. And on top of that, we have this very large opportunity. That opportunity, one of the things that we’ve talked about all the time, we believe time is a weapon that means customers can deploy with us I think uniquely in the world very large networks, very, very rapidly. They value that, they want to deploy this one order across the next two quarters.So you will see that not all hit in Q1, but when you have that order partially shipping in Q1 on top of our base business are being very strong. We’re seeing good solid demand and growth that; one, is clearly above Wall Street expectations, but as we highlighted that kind of growth rate guidance it was rifted if not sustainable.Brad FellerYes. And George to touch on your question about margin, we’ve talked about in the past anytime we have periods of large footprint deployment that’s going to put some downward pressure on our margins. You take the large opportunity we won at the end of the quarter, as well as certain other customers ramping a lot of new footprint that’s going to put some downward pressure on our margins in Q2. But as you know, laying out that tremendous amount of footprint will benefit us significantly in the future.Tom FallonYes. As I’ve always said George, any quarters that our margin is too high we run the risk that we’re not expanding our footprint and our market share fast enough during this phase right now. So, I am not uncomfortable at all with the guidance of our margin because we are putting out so much footprint and that will allow us to monetize that for the long time.George Notter - JefferiesGot it. Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up, so if I look at the delta above where expectations were let’s say for Q2 up to $160 million to $170 million. Is that delta alone just this one particular project that came in and will deploy over two quarters or are you also seeing sort of above expectation strength from your customer base at large?Brad FellerYes. So George, it’s a combination of things. The large deal we talked about is driving part of it, but it’s broad strength across several different customers.George Notter - JefferiesGot it, okay. Thank you very much.Brad FellerOkay.OperatorOur next question comes from Scott Thompson with FBR. Your line is now open.Scott Thompson - FBRHey guys just wanted to go back to the question Simona started with, I think what we’re looking at is invoice shipment composition of the largest customer rather than revenues, does that make a difference? On top of that maybe you can talk a little bit about DTN-X customers, we showed 42 in the quarter and I think we're talking somewhere 45 last quarter if I’m not mistaken. So just wanted to get a think there? And then maybe if you could comment on the Metro opportunities out there; we're hearing a lot from others in the optical space that Metro is heating up. Can you give us an update on that? Thanks.Brad FellerYes. So I’ll take the first couple of parts of that Scott and then I’ll let Tom comment on the Metro piece. So the 21% we said is the largest. We mentioned that there is two that are over 10%. We can’t really say which one is 21 and which one is the smaller one greater than 10%. They are existing customers we’ve had that we have very strong relationships with.Your question on the 42 versus 45, you’ll remember historically, we’ve commented on new customer commitments, so this is activity that we had with customers that was early on where we hadn’t actually shifted invoice to recognize revenue with those customers. Given now that the DTN-X is more mature, we actually shifted that metric to actual invoice revenues, invoice customers that we’ve actually recognized revenue with. So, that’s the difference between the two. We did actually have one new invoice customer for DTN-X this quarter.Tom FallonWe did not have a 45 number before. Last time we said 42 customer commitments, this time it’s 42 invoiced customers and we're no longer talking about customer commitments.Scott Thompson - FBROkay, got it. Thank you.Tom FallonDave, can you talk about Metro?Dave WelchSure. As we’ve indicated before, some portion of what we shift today gets into high capacity Metro. And we have a number of -- we see that as a great opportunity to continue expand our presence in 100-gig technologies. We will continue to compete in high capacity aspects of the Metro market over coming quarters. So, we see this as a growth area for ourselves. However we'll be primarily centered around initially centered around high capacity types of Metro applications.Tom FallonAs we've said last year or last quarter, while we did deliver a pick that was designed for our Metro platform that would compliment what we’re currently doing in the Metro. And we have not put a timeline on that system and I encourage people not to over speculate on that. We anticipate we will be bringing out by Metro based for lower capacity as the market, the economics of the 100-gig for that market make it the primary capacity vehicle and we don't believe that is the case today.If you think back to the long haul market, the 100-gig long haul market started basically in very late 2009 or early 2010. And we delivered our first platform in the middle of ‘12 when we felt that the economics and the volume for market receptivity was there. And we have done extraordinarily well in taking significant market share. I would expect to have the same type of model for the Metro.Scott Thompson - FBRGot it. Thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Rod Hall with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.Rajagopal Raghunathan - JP MorganHi, this is Rajagopal Raghunathan calling on behalf of Rod Hall. Thanks for taking my question. I've got one question and one follow-up. Sir you mentioned that you are strong on Tier 1, what's the status of Tier 2 and Tier 3, are you seeing any weakness on that?Tom FallonWe mentioned good business with tier 1 and you are asking the tier 2 and tier 3 business has been relatively healthy I believe, is that correct?Rajagopal Raghunathan - JP MorganYes.Tom FallonYes, I am seeing relatively good demand in that market, nothing exceptional, certainly no weakness, we continue that’s been one of our primary markets. It’s not certainly a huge portion of our business but it is a solid part of our business and I continue to see doing relatively wellRajagopal Raghunathan - JP MorganOkay, can you also tell us about the status on the metro optical compatible gear, I mean will it be in a position to bid for Verizon metro projects when that RFP comes out?Tom FallonAs I indicated earlier, our focus and early entry into metro is going to be on high capacity metro applications. We already -- some of our products its way in there today. And we got a number of enhancements that allow us to create greater market share in metro area coming out over the coming quarters. And you should look for us to play over time in high capacity metros.Rajagopal Raghunathan - JP MorganOkay, thanks.OperatorOur next question will come from Michael Genovese with MKM Partners. Your line is now open.Michael Genovese - MKM PartnersThanks very much. And congratulations on a good set of numbers. I may have missed this, excuse me if I did but on this large opportunity that you are talking about that’s driving some of this very good second quarter revenue guidance, can you talk about what vertical that customer is in and just talk more about the specifics of that to extent possible. It sounds like these orders came in at the end of 1Q and the revenues going to be recognized in 2Q and 3Q is that the right way to think about this?Tom FallonYes. So, we won the business at the end of Q1 we were awarded the business. The actual POs will come in -- have started to come in now, come in throughout Q2 and the customers expectation is that it will be deployed over the course of Q2 and Q3.Michael Genovese - MKM PartnersAnd can you identify the kind of vertical what this company is in?Tom FallonNo, unfortunately we can’t.Michael Genovese - MKM PartnersOkay. But is it a U.S. customer?Tom FallonYes.Michael Genovese - MKM PartnersAnd can we say that it’s not the Level 3, I mean can we say who it isn’t?Tom FallonYes it’s a different opportunity than the Level 3 when we have talked about.Michael Genovese - MKM PartnersOkay, great. And then last question for me is just on the international, I mean those recognized revenue basis international was down pretty big quarter-over-quarter, were the order trends any different than that and what’s the confidence level and where is the visibility in the pipeline on international business coming back in 2Q and 3Q?Tom FallonYes, so we continue to have a strong pipeline of activity in the international region and in APAC specifically as well as EMEA. Sometimes with new customers, it takes time for those new initial deployments to come out. We did have a exceptionally strong 2013 and specifically Q4 in APAC so it’s really just the timing thing Mike, nothing else to read into it. We have ramped our activity with channel partners which we think we will continue to help the international revenues. Those are relatively early relationships as well. So, we are still very confident about our ability to grow internationally, it’s really just the timing thing in Q1.Michael Genovese - MKM PartnersOkay, alright. Congrats again.Tom FallonThank you.OperatorOur next question will come from Alex Henderson with Needham. Your line is now open.Alex Henderson - NeedhamI got behind Mike this time instead of one in front of him. We’re dueling for a position here. A couple of questions. One, could you talk a little bit about any exposure you might have to what’s going on in Russia and Ukraine and if that might impact any revenues or receivables over time? Second, can you talk a little bit about if you’re seeing any change in pricing environment? It seems like the industry is accelerating and price might be getting a little less pressured as a result of the acceleration. So, can you give us a little bit of feedback on these two points?Tom FallonOne in regard to Russia, we are watching it probably like everybody else is. We’re continuing to extend sales efforts there. We’re continuing to make progress with our customers there. It has not disrupted anything to-date but it’s a pretty small number as part of our base to begin with. I don’t think there is risk or payment problems at this point. And we’re watching it guardedly. We’re not going to certainly give up on a selling into Russia and we’re going to account on anything until it happens, so we’ll see. In regard to pricing…Alex Henderson - NeedhamSo, you can match that with the hedging, so that you’re protected against any exchange rate swings?Brad FellerYes. It’s just, Alex, it’s not really a big enough number to really move the needle. So, we’re watching it, but it hasn’t become a problem yet.Tom FallonYes. I think in Russia I see a over a longer period of time, a lot of opportunity. We’ve made some tractions with customers there already. We have other opportunities that are coming. And my suspicion is the anxiety that everybody is feeling today will abate itself over some period of time. And I still see a lot of investment happen there. And assuming that our countries allow free trade to occur, we anticipate participating in that. And I don’t think there is a risk of capital there. Right now.In regard to pricing, I’m going to -- the thing we said through last period of time, pricing has gone to a relatively normal model in the industry. Don’t confuse yourself, there is always pricing pressure in this industry, because the industry continues to be over served, but the pricing pressure today is distinctly different than it was couple of years ago and the dollar per bit, I see reducing as much more on classical historic terms.Alex Henderson - NeedhamTwo last really quick questions, I didn’t catch up book to bill and then second, relative to the metro, are you seeing metro deployments coming in sooner than you would have expected the activity around that or do you still think that it’s same longer timeline? Some people talked about coming in earlier, some people saying no, no, no that’s not happening, it’s really ‘15 and ’16. What’s your view on that? Thank you.Brad FellerYes. So the book to bill is fairly flat quarter-to-quarter. Yes. And then I’ll let Tom address the other piece of the question.Tom FallonYes. And Alex on the book to bill, we don’t comment on book to bill. So, you didn’t miss it. In regard to metro, we’ve been pretty clear. It’s an area we’re investing in, we think it’s an area that’s important to us. We believe and as I keep abreast of everything that’s happening, there is always going to be some early adaptors in certain verticals that adopt certain technology, regardless of the economics of that technology. I think that in the metro 100-gig right now is the most cost effective solution, if you have fiber exhaust you might have to do it, if you want to invest to getting explored technologies, you might need what to do then. I think the mass market, everything I see still says the ‘15, ‘16 timeframe and that’s what I continue to believe.Dave WelchYes, I think I’d add a little bit on to that. If you go back and look at the 10 gig market and you look at 10 gig first penetrated long haul than there is a delayed time between 10 gig, between the metro transition from 2.5 gig to 10 gig, it’s the same process here. Understand the vast majority of the wavelengths that are in the metro today are 10 gig. They will start converting over time, it will be at least a couple of maybe even a few years, before you have reached that peak transition in the wavelengths and the complete metro network.Alex Henderson - NeedhamThank you very much.Tom FallonYou bet.OperatorOur next question will come from Dmitry Netis with William Blair. Your line is now open.Dmitry Netis - William BlairThank you very much. Nice quarter guys and outlook.Tom FallonThanks Dmitry.Dmitry Netis - William BlairCouple of questions, on the large deal, I hate to beat the dead horse to death here, but can you say that’s not from CenturyLink? I think you mentioned that as a customer last quarter.Tom FallonYes. So, Dmitry, unfortunately we can’t get into who specifically the customer is. We’d love to, but unfortunately we can’t.Dmitry Netis - William BlairOkay, alright, good. And on the growth and operating, like gross margin operating expense lines, I think George had asked the question on gross margin, but I wanted to follow-up on the OpEx, that’s moving up by about $5 million next quarter or this quarter. Is that just truly a function of higher revenues, as you expect? And do you expect that to return sort of a mid 50 levels that it’s been tracking and I am certainly mindful of that 20% R&D target that you put out, so just kind of get some color on that?Brad FellerI mention there is a little bit of stand that pushed out from Q1. So that’s a little bit of it, but the reality is we have talked about several other adjacent markets that we want to go address, and we have talked about maintaining inside the 20% of R&D. So we will continue to balance inside those parameters, but you should expect the R&D and overall OpEx to be at similar levels for the next several quarters.Tom FallonOur commitment is to grow operating expenses less rapidly than we are growing revenue and we are going to do that. The good news in my mind, we have a whole deck of things that we know we want to go up and build. We think that there is a massive opportunity for us and right now, if I were to unleash the R&D budget, we could go and attack these much more rapidly, but I committed to the shareholders and I am going to be mindful that we are here to make money and we are going to do it at a reasonable rates, but as revenues go up, I plan on spending R&D dollars at 20%. And if we have opportunities to increase that we are going to do that because we see the opportunities ahead of us over the next few years as being pretty magnificent.Dmitry Netis - William BlairOkay. So if I missed it is which I said it’s 59 over the next couple of quarters is basically sort of the run rate that we should be expecting, is that correct?Tom FallonYes. I would model a 20% of revenues but 59 set of numbers, 59, 60 is a good number to model long-term.Dmitry Netis - William BlairOkay, great, thank you. Appreciate that color. And then the last question would be on the submarine market one of the key stakeholders reported this morning and I think they sighted diminished demand in the submarine sector, they also lowered the 2014 target by about a $100 million. So my question is have you seen any slowdown and weakness in this market given you had fair amount of success there and how does that factored into your guidance? Thank you.Tom FallonSubmarine is a smaller, but an important sector for us, we have focused on identifying and working with customers that we think are strong players in that space we do not see our customers as becoming weak in that perspective as a matter of fact our technologies over the last six months have increased or improved our differentiated position within that, to the extent we talk about a variety of technology to be soft decision fact or we have talked about recently our fast shared mesh protection that is also applicable within some of the submarine networks. So we see that as being a good-good market for us going forward.Dmitry Netis - William BlairOkay, great. Thank you. Keep up the good work gentlemen.Brad FellerThank you.Operator(Operator Instructions). Our next question will come from Subu Subrahmanyan with Juda Group. Your line is now open.Subu Subrahmanyan - Juda GroupThank you. I have two questions. First Tom you mentioned a couple of times that there could be some lumpiness there how to shift the revenue levels with some large contracts coming in now. So if you look at 2014 from a bigger picture level how are you thinking about year-over-year growth for the market and the opportunities for Infinera exceed? Is it fair to say that given this large opportunities working out over the next couple of quarters any lumpiness is likely in the fourth quarter? And then the second question is on adjacent opportunities clearly metro is one that you have talked about integration more packets switching capability? And then other one, can you just talk about when you talk about increase investments in adjacent opportunities, what some of those are and what the timeline of some of those could be?Tom FallonSure. So the rapid as you know, we’ve said for a long time this is a lumpy business. Sometimes we say that because it’s a down quarter, this time we’re saying it because it’s an exceptionally a strong quarter. And we did see it spending the next couple of quarters. So, if there is any risk it probably would be around in the Q4 timeframe. That part of that is we anticipate shipping this one big opportunity in the next two quarters and just candidly because of our rapid lead times, Q4 is a long way away, we don’t see what we don’t see. I have no belief that demand falls off. But I can’t see it, yes so I just want to be disclosing what we see and what we don’t see. So hopefully that answers your question.In regard to new opportunities, certainly the Metro is an opportunity; certainly you mentioned packet is an opportunity. We’ve shown and demonstrated the packet capability. And you can anticipate we’ll be launching a product before 2Q along.We see and you’ve seen a lot of demonstrations around SDN, we continue to make reasonable investments in SDN. And we think that’s an important technology for us because quite frankly our Infinera architecture is perfect for an SDN environment, an infinite pool of intelligent capacity. What we’ve done from day one leverages what SDN is trying to do perfectly.So you will see us making investments there. And you will see us invest more in products focused on LAN, data center WAN interconnect that’s going to be an important market for us too. Partly kind of a Metro application, but we do see some specific requirements for the Web 2.0 people that we think with our pick capability we’re uniquely able to address.So, lots and lots of opportunities more than we can afford to do. If time was the measurement stick, but we think we can do it successfully and build good market acceptance for our technologies of architectures.Subu Subrahmanyan - Juda GroupAnd Tom do you think some of these will start contributing other than revenue perspective, we are seeing today the bases long haul focus. When do they start to become important adjacent revenue opportunities as well?Dave WelchRight, this is Dave again. The new technologies come out on a regular basis and you understand especially in the long haul market that the people need to deploy networks in the ground that are anticipating future capabilities, such as SDN, such as MPLS or mutli-layered intelligence structure in the transport capability. I think we’re benefiting from it now.The reason why we are taking, winning the large opportunities on a regular basis is because I appreciate that our platform is differentiated in the ability to offer a multi-layered management to be able to manage whether it’s an OTN service or a packet service across the network more efficiently than alternative systems.As we bring out the capabilities and we’ve talked about things like fast shared mesh protection, which takes some of the protection mechanisms out of the layer three structure moves it into an intelligent transport structure, makes our networks more efficient, it helps us to deliver better packet serve and packet services across the network.And so, we're benefiting now. And as we continue to roll out, the market is definitely motivated to move from a mid-network layer three infrastructure to an intelligent transport network in an OTN centric network in the long haul.Subu Subrahmanyan - Juda GroupGot it. Thank you.OperatorOur next question will come from Brian Cline with National Alliance. Your line is now open.Unidentified AnalystHey guys, long time. Let's say first time caller. So, thanks for taking my questions.Tom FallonNice to meet you Brian.Unidentified AnalystYes. Thank you, thank you. Real quick, I want to go back to gross margin for just a moment. I think just putting sort of a longer term perspective on it, it’s at least the reason historically you talked about that roughly 40% level being as I think Tom as you said, is the level you sort of want to target if in the land grab or sort of the footprint acquisition mode that you're in. So I mean, I think if you take the commentary qualitatively, which you said I’d probably get back down and said were you looking to probably 36% to 38% gross margin.So, I guess I'm just wondering, if you look, you had a crystal ball looking a little bit further ahead, if you wanted to kind of come out or exit out of sort of this big lump of demand that's coming up here in Q2 and looks to extend in Q3. I mean would you sort of reset that kind of expectation for a baseline gross margin as you continue to deploy common equipment and gain footprint.Brad FellerYes. So, I think we've talked about being low 40s for the year, I don't think that has changed. We’ve talked about getting into 2015 and starting to see more fill from some of the DTN-X deployments, which obviously has the phenomenon on pushing up our overall gross margins.As Tom mentioned earlier, when you see us having lower gross margins in periods where we have significant growth that is a great thing for us over the long-term, because we do see this as a great opportunity to go build that footprint and to be able to leverage that for many years to come in the future.Tom FallonOne thing Brad teased at in his commentary was if you look back over time and look back to when we are doing kind of the similar thing with 10 gig with the DTN, our current margin is many points higher than it was during our last kind of land grab in 10 gig. And that’s a good sign that the cost structure of the company has improved, and we can more effectively earn this footprint at a higher margin.And typically when we were going through that phase on the DTN with the 10 gig, about six quarters later, we started seeing sustentative fill to those chasses we deployed enhancing our margin structure of a company. I would anticipate the same type of cycle here.Unidentified AnalystYes, I was actually and my follow up just to try to figure out, you talked about timing being a weapon for guys, and if that else just sort of extends the fill aspect, as you see customers making demand I guess sort of making store decisions based on how rapidly they can deploy a few versus let’s competitor, does that also sort of extend into, how quickly they want to fill those [wild cards]?Tom FallonA lot of it depends quite frankly on what demand they see, they can create in their markets. So once they have the infrastructure in place, what services are they bring into market, what price point are they bringing to market, what customers are they attracting that are going to be able to bring users to their network. And typically what we are seeing is people with an Infinera infrastructure are able to respond much more rapidly to those opportunities than other people. If a large Web 2.0 company comes to a wholesaler or somebody, a tier 2, and they have an Infinera infrastructure, our customers can respond, we commit days or less, you could have built from us in your network. And that is I think a competitive weapon for our customers. They value that and quite frankly that enhances our ability to fill our chasses faster.Unidentified AnalystThat’s great. Very helpful.Tom FallonDown to internet demand right, as long as there is internet demand, there is going to be growth opportunities; if that were to abate, there would be a problem, not just for us but for the internet suppliers.Unidentified AnalystOkay. Makes sense. And then a couple of quick housekeeping ones, did you give your headcount number anywhere? And then secondly, Just maybe I have misheard, I don’t know if you’ve confirmed that neither of your two 10% customers in Q1 were new customers if they are both existing customers?Brad FellerYes, so the headcount is in the press release, so we added 28 people over the course of the quarter. And then in terms of your question on the new customer, we added one new customer on DTN-X it is an existing customer. Top two or both existing customers.Unidentified AnalystGot it, great. Thanks guys.Tom FallonOkay.OperatorWe have another additional question from Alex Henderson with Needham. Your line is open.Alex Henderson - NeedhamYes thanks, just a couple of quick housekeeping questions. The R&D swing from 1Q to 2Q, it sounds like that’s pushing R&D up a little faster than it would go on a normal glide path, should we anticipate that that flattens it out or even edges it down as we go into the 3Q, is that the right way to think about that Q-to-Q, take the average of the two, is it more of the base rate?Brad FellerNo, you should probably model the year at that similar rate and your parameters for the year is that 20% of R&D.Alex Henderson - NeedhamOkay, I see. And the second question I wanted to ask you is on the tax rate and interest line, any kind of guidance of how we should be seeing that going over the course of the year? It’s obviously got a lot of NOLs but I would think that some local taxes would increase if it goes back to the international mix, is that right way to think about it?Brad FellerYes I mean Alex I would model it similar for the rest of the year. Things move around in there, but no big drivers in those numbers.Alex Henderson - NeedhamAnd then finally, the last question I have for you is the service line dipped somewhat sequentially that’s a little unusual for service. I assume that was driven by installation services predominantly in the prior quarter falling off a little bit and hence the margin improvement, is that right? And then second, should we anticipate that the service mix trends back towards a more installation mix as a result of this large installation program around this large order over the next couple of quarters?Brad FellerYes. So it’s a couple of things why Q4 is stronger, there was a very strong deployment quarter. It tends to be the renewal quarter for a lot of the ongoing software and warranty type of items. Those are the things that move it. Like I said Q4 was exceptionally strong. Going forward from quarter-to-quarter the levels installed can vary. So, it’s a little bit of a tough one to predict going forward. But you should see the deployment, obviously there is large opportunity, we expect services to be with that. So over time it should drift up.Tom FallonThank you for joining us this afternoon and for your questions. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress. Have a great day.OperatorAnd with that we conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.")
# 2014 q2
infn.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from George"
            " Notter with Jefferies. Go ahead sir. Your line is open.George Notter - JefferiesHi there. Thanks very much guys. Can you hear me?Tom FallonYes.Brad FellerYes.George Notter - JefferiesGreat thanks. Alright, so I wanted to touch on your commentary about intermediate visibility I guess returning back to normal levels, (indiscernible) are you talking about there, are we looking at kind of Q4 being below seasonal norms, is it a byproduct of bookings or backlog, is it just simply that this large customer you have got here in Q2 and then now also in Q3 just kind of rolls over and finishes up their network build I mean can you kind of give us more flavor for what’s going on there? Thanks.Dave WelchSure George what we have said historically is kind of normal visibility is we had a really good feeling for the first quarter and not much data yet supporting definitive answer for the quarter after that. The last couple of quarters we have been pretty clear that visibility was higher than usual and we had pretty much – pretty good two quarter look. So I think we are kind of back to the normal. The current quarter we understand pretty well. Next quarter we have a lot of indications that there is a lot pipeline activity. We see lots of RFQs. There is lots of potential new customers but there is just less fidelity around the specifics of those on either timing or if we will win.I think one of the reasons is we have been carrying bigger backlog than we desire. I have been I think pretty crystal clear for years now about time as a weapon. And we can only do that obviously if when customers order they get that product pretty quickly. We have been running a couple of weeks longer in lead time than I desire from a customer support perspective. So as we have ramped up we are going to bring that back down to what I consider normal levels where we represent another unique value proposition to our customers. And we have longer lead time and more backlog as it takes longer for people to get their gear. They also then have to digest that gear. And I think that in conjunction with visibility being more normal, we also have a little bit of higher backlog that causes other people’s plans or our customers’ plans to be less clear. There is nothing in my mind alarming about this view. It’s just going back to normal.George Notter - JefferiesGot it. Okay. Fair enough. And then I also wanted to ask about the gross margins obviously real strong here in Q2 and you talked about 2014 being a year of footprint grab, can we think a little bit about 2015 I think in the past you guys have kind of talked about the market potentially going back to a more normal mix of line cards versus chassis, how do you see that playing out and what gives you the confidence that we kind of return to that more normal mix and what does that therefore translate into terms of what gross margins could look like out into next year? Thanks.Brad FellerSure. So we – as we have talked about in the past on a normal basis between 18 months and two years after initial deployments customers will come back for their next layer of fill. Obviously, we saw some strong fill activity in Q2 which is why you saw the stronger gross margin results. We still expect in 2015 to continue to grow footprint but that level of fill we expect to continue to ramp up and become stronger and stronger throughout 2015 to where you start to get to on a more steady-state basis a more normalized mix. And as a result you start to see margins more like our midpoint model of 45 points.Tom FallonThe longer it takes us to get there George quite frankly the better off we are in long-term shareholders, but I agree with Brad we anticipate that that starting to balance out next year.George Notter - JefferiesGreat. Thanks very much, guys.Brad FellerThanks George.OperatorYour next question comes from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Go ahead. Your line is open.Simona Jankowski – Goldman SachsHi, I did have one follow-up on the gross margin question. So I think you discussed the interplay of the mix there between fill and footprint, but can you also give us an update on where you are in terms of both utilization and yield in the fab and I have recognized you don’t disclose the precise numbers, but if you can just give us the sense for how much head room is there as well?Tom FallonYes. So Simona, I can give you some directionality but we breakout that level of detail. You can believe that the team continues to drive up the yields of the products in the fab. And as we continue to grow the overall revenue numbers, we are increasing the levels of capacity that we are absorbing in the fab. There is still some room to grow there though.Brad FellerI will give a slightly more color. I would say our yields overall are at or slightly above plan, so we are executing to what we think we actually have a lot of experiences now. We are being a little bit favorable on the current yield we are experiencing. And on the capacity perspective, we do marginally increment income capacity periodically with CapEx, but we still have a reasonable amount of headroom to afford ourselves a lot of growth with the current infrastructure.Simona Jankowski – Goldman SachsAnd so as we think about you guys expanding into adjacencies, as you started to detail in terms of the Metro opportunity, I mean roughly how many years should we think about you having headroom ahead of you in terms of capacity and how many points of gross margin upside do you think there is to grow into as you expand your revenue base?Brad FellerYes. So Simona, it really depends on how much success we get in these adjacent markets. As Tom mentioned there is a reasonable amount of headroom there, but we like the new products we are coming out and our hope is that we run out of capacity quicker than longer. So that’s kind of the dynamic I would look at in terms of that component.Simona Jankowski – Goldman SachsAnd then just last question on the…Tom FallonSimona real quickly, this is Tom. Some of our CapEx in the fab has a fairly longer lead time cycle of both buying it and then deploying it somewhere in the 18 months to 3 year type of timeframe. Don’t anticipate us making any of those purchases this year, but as we start making those kind of decisions we would certainly make that available to the shareholder community, because it’s a long-term investment.Simona Jankowski – Goldman SachsSure, sure. Appreciate that. And just one last question on the timing of the Metro opportunity which I think before you had kind of talked about the real volume in the industry which is typically what you look to intercept happening more towards the end of 2015, but now you kind of broke that opportunity up into two parts kind of the aggregation piece and the cloud piece and it sounds like the cloud piece you think will be taking off in early ’15, so is that a little bit of change in the timing of when you think you will be intercepting that opportunity?Tom FallonWe are going to try to always intercept opportunities as the opportunity becomes interesting which is with volume. And you can anticipate we are going go hard after both the cloud interconnect market and the more long-haul market or aggregation market. And Simona, I am in hold off on giving any more details because I am excited about people coming to visit us in September to get a deep drive on what we are doing.Simona Jankowski – Goldman SachsOkay, sounds good, I’m planning right. Thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Sanjiv Wadhwani of Stifel. Go ahead. Your line is open.Sanjiv Wadhwani – StifelThank you. Tom, I wanted to ask you about some of the M&A that’s taking place in the industry specifically with your customers, you guys have some decent exposure on the cable side, I would love to get any details on if you are seeing any sort of lumpiness in spending because of M&A and then thoughts on sort of spending in that vertical going forward? Thanks.Tom FallonYes. So far, we have not – we have commented on this before seeing any disruption of spend. I anticipate that through this year, there won’t be a positive or negative impact. I think as that specific deal I think you are referencing comes closer to fruition we will have a better insight into it for next year. So I think it’s too early to call what it means for next year. For this year, I think it doesn’t have any impact at least to us, I can’t speak for everybody in the industry, but not to us.Sanjiv Wadhwani – StifelGot it, okay. And then Brad, I think for next year you were commenting about sort of gross margins and as you see more fills etcetera that will help gross margins, you commented about 45% sort of which is more normalized midpoint. Are you sort of guiding to 45% gross margins for 2015 or any color over there, thanks.Brad FellerYes. So, Sanjiv, we don’t guide over more than a one quarter period, I’m just trying to give you a feel for the fact that they should be in those types of levels over the course of the year, obviously that can change from quarter-to-quarter but you should see a step function up in ’15 and in ’16. In the longer term, we think there is even more headroom from there as we to smartest point continues to fill the fab and growing these adjacent markets.Sanjiv Wadhwani - StifelGot it, that’s helpful. Thank you.Brad FellerSure.OperatorOur next question comes from Alex Henderson of Needham. Go ahead, your line is open.Alex Henderson - NeedhamYes, let me start up with the most mundane, there was little crackling on the line when you gave the EPS number was wondering if you could just repeat it?Brad FellerIt’s a $0.07 plus or minus $0.02.Alex Henderson - NeedhamPlus or minus, thank you. The question I wanted to ask as you made a tantalizing comment about soon to be announced new products, obviously you’re not announcing them here, but can you give us some sense of when we might be anticipating those product announcements, any granularity on that?Tom FallonI like to use the word tantalizing. That gives me great expectations that will be great interest. We have a history of not bringing things to market or launching things or really expressing them and so, they are pretty closed to being ready to go to customers. I’m not never been an advocate of doing kind of product launches away ahead of time. So, you should anticipate that it’s in the relatively near-term.Alex Henderson - NeedhamSuper, I look forward to hearing about those at the Analyst Day, I guess.Tom FallonIt is in the quiet period so, we have to be very careful of not talking at all about finances.Alex Henderson - NeedhamThere you go.Tom FallonYou were tantalizing about products and technology.Alex Henderson - NeedhamYes. So, can you go a little bit into a little bit more granularity in the European theatre on whether the situation in the Ukraine Russian markets are having any impact on you guys in any form, fashion or other variable?Tom FallonYes, I think, Brad commented that the first half of the year was a little slower in Europe I think part of it is just North America, has been remarkably strong. But we don’t see any fundamental problem in the bulk of the European business and we anticipate as had commented that in the second half of the year, we see some reasonably good opportunities and I anticipate as a percentage of business that will increase. In regard to Russia specifically, we’ve commented before that we’re continuing to sell in Russia. On the last call, we made a comment that we’re staying mindful of the uncertainty and if anything in the last quarter that uncertainty in my mind has grown quite substantially. We continue to see in Russia. We continue to see opportunities in Russia and I continue to be growing more cautious on baking that into our forecast in the near-term.Alex Henderson - NeedhamOkay. So, is there any financial risk as a result of those transactions in terms of exchange rate swings or cost elements that we should be thinking about?Brad FellerNo, no, Tom’s commentary that the current business we don’t expect to see any impact, it’s just – it may impact the timing and size of future deals.Alex Henderson - NeedhamOkay. Going back to the metro side of it for a second, Sienna made the comment that 20% of their sales of coherent went into the metro last quarter. Would you characterize the market currently as straight cloud interconnect within that context of the granularity that you gave earlier? It seems like the coherent market is seeing some move into metro, but it’s not clear from what’s been said whether you would – which category that would fit into?Brad FellerYes, there as Dave Welch - we have started before we do supply some of our products in the high capacity metro or even metro regional markets. The application of that is high-capacity aggregation rings and/or high-capacity datacenter connections to that. That is – if you look at the historical numbers of the growth rate and total unit volume that we expect out of the Metro market it is insignificant to the opportunity that’s out there. So currently we supply with the exclusion of China we supply – are the largest supplier of 100 gig technologies out there. And we expect to the Metro market to turn on as Tom indicated from volume perspective from the data center connections start turning on more so in ‘15. And the aggregation rings late ’15, beginning of ‘16. You will see applications within that, prior to those dates but from a volume perspective I don’t think they will really be that accelerating until those timeframes.Tom FallonOne of the things I’m asking I think about Alex is we certainly understand that today, there are some 100 gig coherent being deployed in the Metro. I pick the word interesting for the volume of it carefully. If you look back on the long-haul market, the initial 100 big coherent entered the market in 2010, the market became interesting 2012, 2013 timeframe. That’s when the bulk of the decisions were made, that’s when the bulk of the dollars started to ramp, it’s when market share was earned. And it’s the path we followed with the DTN-X and I think has served us quite well. So when we say that 100 gig in the Metro because interesting in 2015 late ’15, ‘16, you should kind of map into that kind of model.Alex Henderson - NeedhamOkay. One last question then I will cede the floor. So in looking at companies like Google pushing out 500,000 server data centers these hectare scale plants and then connecting them with DWDM systems, will there be a difference in the scale of the initial deployments, when they do a data center to data center build in terms of the capacity necessities that implies that then your typical build on a long-haul back bone or Metro back bone, I would assume that they would have much larger initial point-to-point capacity needs and therefore the utilization of the box would be higher initially than the traditional loadings, is that correct?Tom FallonSo the right way to think about and to scale these 100 acre types of data center scenarios is 0.5 million servers, you have got 70-30, 80-20 type of internal traffic to external traffic. So yes, the scale of the connections of the external traffic from these large data centers can be large. It is unclear of how many of these huge data centers will be built, but it’s certainly a great opportunities to see the bandwidth growth associated with that. So if you want to do your math and you think about the type of traffic and really 70-30, 80-20 is not a bad ratio for the traffic that stays in the building versus the traffic that goes outside the building.Alex Henderson – NeedhamSo the loadings are going to be comparable smaller, bigger, can you give us some sense of what the initial builds look like?Tom FallonI think if you take your number of 500,000 servers and they are operating at various stages of 10 gigabit or 40 gigabit types of capabilities you can add up bandwidth pretty quickly and what that looks like.Alex Henderson – NeedhamThanks.Brad FellerIt’s obviously pretty high fill rates within the internet content provider space in comparison to more traditional markets.Alex Henderson – NeedhamThank you. That’s very helpful.OperatorOur next question comes from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Go ahead. Your line is open.Ashwin Kesireddy - JPMorganHi, thanks for taking my question, this is Ashwin on behalf of Rod. I was hoping you could clarify one the comments you made it on sustainability of momentum being dependent on capacity expansions, is that more related to revenue momentum or gross margins upside. My second question really is on Tom you talked about having the technology and capability to support inter – data center interconnects now what additional features do you think you will need to have in order to develop for traditional Metro product, I guess and finally, and then I was hoping you could comment on the concerns around CapEx related to Tier 1s here in the U.S. and probably juxtapose that with your moderated view on medium-term, is there any underlying softness in the market or does it make sense that this concerns are on CapEx will have any impact on the optically generally?Brad FellerSo, I will take the first part of the question and let Tom address the second part. The first part of your question related to gross margin, so we were talking about where in the low 40s margin will end. We will depend highly on that mix of footprint and fill.Tom FallonI want to make sure we didn’t confuse you talking about capital expansion internally in the short-term driving margin issues. There is no substantive CapEx expenditures planned internally right now. So, I don’t want you walking away saying or thinking we have to go and put a lot of CapEx into expanding the fab. We have good yield profile. We have good availability to expand our output based upon our current CapEx infrastructure with normal spend of what 5% of revenue on that. So, you shouldn’t assume any kind of change in model of that. Does that answer the question?Ashwin Kesireddy - JPMorganYes, thanks.Tom FallonIn regard to Tier 1 CapEx, and I am going to Dave talk about technology for ICP. Tier 1 CapEx, I made a couple of comments, we are up to now 16 Tier 1s. We had a Tier 1 that was a top five customer. Our business with Tier 1s continues to be robust. Is the Tier 1 market afford us lot of opportunity to grow with that? It does. But we are not seeing any kind of specific challenges. I know I have made this comment before typically when people ask about Tier 1s, they are specifically asking about AT&T and Verizon CapEx. We don’t have real exposure to that. So, I don’t really have any insight for you other than the comment, I continue to believe that, those two players in that market continue to get undo type of view for how much of the market they are. They are important, but I think that other spaces, Internet content, cable, wholesale are driving a huge amount of the CapEx expansion. And for transport, the discussion around the Tier 1s defining the market, I really think is not a good service to the view. In regard to the technology for the Internet content space in addition to PICs, I don’t know Dave if you want to make any comments or…Dave WelchI mean, the Internet content space along with frankly a good chunk of the restaurant market, their number one need is scalable technology, the ability to deliver high bandwidth and the growth of bandwidth for that. If you look, here you are in a transition from 10 to 100 gigabit, 40 gigabit being a very short lift opportunity, it’s a huge – it’s a result of a shift in high capacity demand still growing. So, the technologies are very similar. This is where our original focus, which was on developing photonic integrated circuits, in order to manage high-capacity opportunities, and developing intelligent transport networks for the convergence of digital and optical technologies and a kind of a platform. It has served us well and we’ll continue to service very well. Being optimized – optimize offerings for high-capacity at scale deployments is directly – it’s kind of the target of our technology choices.Ashwin Kesireddy - JPMorganOkay, thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Genovese of MKM Partners. Go ahead sir. Your line is open.Michael Genovese - MKM PartnersGreat, thanks a lot. Listening to your commentary, it sounds to me like the Level 3 100-G footprint build may have slipped into the third quarter from the second quarter, can you comment on that?Brad FellerYes. So, Mike, we can’t comment on any specific – what mobile will do in the third quarter, this kind of stuff, what I will say about Level 3 is we mentioned that they were going to come on as the 100-gig customer this year. They have – they have ramped probably a little bit slower than we expected, but for the year, we think they will do a nice piece of business with us and will be a great customer in a 100-gig for a long time.Michael Genovese - MKM PartnersOkay. For the record ports in 2Q, can you just generally talk about in general terms, the percentage that’s tied to new footprint build in that quarter and then the percentage that’s channel fill related to networks that were built in previous quarters. Can you give us a sense of that?Tom FallonMaybe I can make a comment. We don’t break it out between how much of our build is for new build or fill. The vast majority of our networks to-date are likely filled that we have deployed. So, there is still a tremendous amount of growth to be had in that and we continue to put on significant amount of new footprint every quarter and we expect that trend that to continue.Michael Genovese - MKM PartnersOkay. And then last one from me, just a comment about the fourth quarter that you made, I think Tom you said something about a flat to down quarter, which makes sense, but I just wanted to clarify whether you are using 3Q or 2Q as the base, which we might be flat to down from in 4Q?Tom FallonYes. Most importantly, I did not comment that it will be flat or down or up. We said that that we have gone to more normal visibility. I think Brad commented that based on that visibility, it brings us more uncertainty of whether we will be able to maintain the revenue of Q3. Please don’t read anything more into that, than what we said.Michael Genovese - MKM PartnersOkay. Well, congratulations on the great results and guidance.Tom FallonThank you very much.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Dmitry Netis of William Blair. Go ahead. Your line is open.Dmitry Netis - William BlairThanks. Two quick ones for me. Nice win there with XO obviously existing customers. Yes, in the past I think Tom, it covered around 10% of revenue somewhere in that ballpark, is it reasonable to expect that during this DTN-X cycle this customer can achieve sort of the same revenue breakdown?Tom FallonWell, I am not going to comment on what percentage they might have been in the past. It varies so much quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Obviously, they are a very large customer. We have a great relationship with them. They have the potential of buying a lot of gear, but we are not a soul source there. There is another person that is also qualified in that we have earned a second spot. And I think we are going to have a lot of good opportunity with them, but I’d cautious of baking in any kind of percentage of our corporate revenue based on them.Dmitry Netis - William BlairOkay. And are there deploying as we speak or is this sort of a timeline issue?Tom FallonThey are deploying as we speak and I anticipate they are going to deploy for a long, long time.Dmitry Netis - William BlairGreat. Okay, good. And then the second question on the R&D that 20% of revenue, is that an annual number, I think that’s what you said? If that’s the case, are you basically guiding that both ‘15 and ‘16 should be modeled at that 20% on the annual basis?Brad FellerYes, that’s the target and it will have some small fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter, but 20% of revenues is what we are targeting. Obviously, we have alluded to several times in both Tom’s and I’s prepared remarks about going after adjacent markets. So, we do think 20% of revenue is a good level for us in balancing both our future roadmap, but also looking at the profitability of the business.Tom FallonYes, I will comment. Just a clarity on what Brad said, I think for ‘15 certainly 20% is a reasonable number to model. I think over time what we have said that as achieved certain scales, we believe that we should be able to bring that down as a percentage. We will always be a technology company. We will always be a deep R&D company. Beyond ‘15, quite frankly, I don’t know enough yet to say what the number will be. So 20% is the max, but at some point, you should think about it’s not a permanent 20%. I don’t know what the scaled number is, but it’s not a permanent 20%.Dmitry Netis - William BlairRight, right. That helps. And then the reason I ask this question because you obviously have this spur of activity with regards to metro launch and product development. And coming in 2016, I get that there is different items on the roadmap, but whether they take as much of R&D as metro is what I was trying to ascertain here. So, thank you very much. That’s helpful.Tom FallonYou bet.OperatorOur next question comes from Brian Coyne of National Alliance. Go ahead sir, your line is open.Brian Coyne - National AllianceHey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Two quick ones. First, help me understand just maybe a little bit of your commentary around sort of the more normalized outlook. If you go back to the end of the last quarter, would the improvement in the outlook that you had sort of into 2Q and – is that really driven by that one large North American order, that’s being deployed or was it sort of more broad-based? And so I guess I am just trying to understand when you are thinking about little farther out into Q3 and Q4, is it just because that one order sort of that sled moves through the business and then everything else kind of really didn’t change or it was more the visibility sort of also impacted by any changes in any other customers?Tom FallonI think if you look at our results over the last couple of quarters we have been pretty consistent that we have had a pretty mixed bag of customers as top five, cable guys, internet content guys, wholesalers, Tier 1s. And what I would say is that we are in a very fortunate position of having a lot of opportunities spread a lot across a lot of vertical places and we had this incremental order that was substantive on top of that. That created one bigger backlog than we feel comfortable maintaining while promising time as a weapon, but it created hugely beneficial visibility, because of the combination of both those things or all those things hitting simultaneously. So, it was a much broader base than one big order from one guy.Brian Coyne - National AllianceGot it. That’s helpful. And then I guess secondly, your comment on the more rationale pricing environment, sort of does that imply – I mean, is it just simply the fact that some of the legacy guys aren’t showing it maybe quite as consistently or is there something else perhaps that’s just driving the rationality that you are seeing? And I guess sort of the follow-on to that is, does that condition in the pricing environment give you any additional headroom to maybe price a bit more aggressively as you look to gain (indiscernible) sort of over the next year, year and a half?Tom FallonI am not going to advocate that we price more aggressively. I think we are pricing fairly and we are competitive. And I think our customers appreciate the value proposition. And I think that part of it is the winners, I think being defined in the 100-gig market are becoming pretty declared. I have actually had some customers on deals we have won tell me that the competition was so slow and these are with some people that were, I would say, financially not necessarily as solid as others that it causes them alarm that if they are pricing that way, it makes them concern for the competitors, our competitors’ long-term viability. That’s a nice place to be for a change when low price actually can cause a customer to be concerned about the long-term liability. I think that as I have said there is going to be new winners and new losers as we move to this 100-gig coherent, the supper-channel market. I firmly believe we are a new winner and I think that the market continues to be over-served and it’s going to be rationalized over the next many years both in the long-haul that’s already started and in the metro and we are going to try to accelerate that by going hard into that space. So, for the most part, it’s still very, very competitive. It’s till over-served, but I am seeing and this might change quarter-to-quarter, I am seeing currently fairly rational behavior.Brian Coyne - National AllianceThat’s great, Tom. Thanks a lot and nice job in the quarter.Tom FallonThank you.OperatorAnd I am showing no further questions at this time. So, I will turn the call back over to Mr. Fallon.Tom Fallon - Chief Executive OfficerThank you guys very much for joining us this afternoon for your questions. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress and hope to see you in September.OperatorThis concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.")
# 2014 q3
infn.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Simona Jankowski"
            " of Goldman Sachs.Simona Kiritsov Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionI wanted to ask you first how much you're embedding into your Q4 guidance from the Cloud Xpress launch?Brad D. FellerYes. So in Q4, Simona, Cloud Xpress should be low to mid-single-digit millions of dollars.Simona Kiritsov Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionOkay. And then I think you mentioned that you had a new enterprise win in the quarter. Can you expand on that? Do you mean enterprise or do you mean like a Web 2.0 kind of customer?Thomas J. FallonNo, we mean an enterprise customer. We can't comment on who it is, but you should assume it's like a large industrial type of company. And it's -- I think some of these large companies are going to start looking at building their own DWDM networks for certain applications. Whether it goes somewhere or not, I don't know. But they are buying it, and they're evaluating, I think, both the product and their own strategy.Simona Kiritsov Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionInteresting. I mean, as far as I know, this is your first enterprise customer, is that right? And if so, is this a one-off or is that some kind of an early trend we should keep our eye on?Thomas J. FallonWell, we've sold to enterprises when you consider them like banking industry before through managed services and directly. This is the first type of industrial type of company we've sold to. And here's what I think. I think whether it's next year or the next 10 years more and more people are going to be building more and more data centers. More and more people are going to be building their own kind of optical infrastructure. It's becoming just too much of a fabric of how you do business. So I do think that it is something that we should pay attention to, though I don't think it's going to be something that accelerates rapidly.Simona Kiritsov Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionOkay. Then just last question for me. You mentioned the Instant Bandwidth as one of the drivers of the gross margin upside. Could you just help us quantify that, whether in terms of the actual contribution in the quarter to gross margin or what percent of your revenues utilize that program?Brad D. FellerYes. So Simona, we don't necessarily break out that level of detail. But we have about 20 customers that are utilizing Instant Bandwidth. Most of those customers have not licensed the additional slices of capacity. We expect that to contribute going forward there. It's a good flexibility piece for our customers for certain routes that they have.OperatorOur next question comes from George Notter of Jefferies.George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC, Research DivisionI wanted to ask about the improvement in expectations for Q4. I think going back a couple of quarters ago, you guys were seeing one particular project really driving top line upside in Q2 and then also in Q3. And I think there was a view that the business would kind of step down in Q4. And I guess I'm trying to understand where the strength is coming from in Q4. Is it broad based? Is it driven by a certain customer project or customer win? Can you kind of give us some sense for where the incremental demand is coming from?Brad D. FellerSure. So if you remember back, George, to the Q2 call, Tom had said we have normal visibility in Q4. And what that means for us is we don't have visibility to exactly which customer and which deal. But we had also said that the underlying momentum across the business was strong. As you noted as well, we had a large order that went across Q2 and Q3. So we knew we were going to have a hole in Q4. In addition, given how strong the first 3 quarters had been, we were concerned the customers would've used all their budget and not have much to come back in Q4. That was why we were cautious about Q4. The good news is since then across our business we've seen customers continuing to spend money and wanting to continue to grow both the bandwidth across their existing networks but also grow new networks.George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC, Research DivisionGot it. Okay. So just to be clear, this is a multitude of customers or opportunities or projects that are driving the strength in Q4, it's not just 1 or 2 customers?Brad D. FellerCorrect.George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC, Research DivisionGreat. Okay. And then I also wanted to ask about the DSO calculation. I think I got 71 days this quarter. It's up a few days relative to the prior quarter. And then you also -- relative to recent quarters this year. Is there -- is the business a little bit more back-end loaded this quarter? Is there something different about linearity or the mix of customers? What can you say about that?Brad D. FellerYes. So George, this is not something you should expect to continue. We had a large customer payment that was actually done on day 1 of Q4. So just at the end of the quarter, it was a little bit higher than we would like, but not a trend that you should expect to continue.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Genovese of MKM Partners.Michael Genovese - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionJust a couple of things. First on the Cloud Xpress, should we think about -- I guess there's a little bit of concern about that cannibalizing DTN-X opportunity with the Web 2.0s. Or should we think about with the different kilometer and distance capability that those are distinct applications in distinct markets? What's the risk of cannibalization there?David F. WelchThis is Dave Welch. The Cloud Xpress, the product's targeted at the Metro cloud interconnect. That doesn't really cannibalize any of our long-haul or high-capacity Metro regional products in the DTN-X. So we don't see that eating away at things. And I want to emphasize, eating away is the wrong term. It is really that certain parts of our network over time may transition to that type of platform, but that is still a -- that would be a healthy transition for us.Michael Genovese - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionBut the -- so does the hyper -- given that the top topologies of the hyperscale guys' networks, which they don't do a lot of public speaking about -- and I don't really want you to reveal their plans, which you can't do. But will that group of customers remain a big customer base for DTN-X? Do they have enough long-haul and ultra-long-haul applications that you expect to continue them to be a meaningful target for DTN-X?David F. WelchWhat the DTN-X does is a meshed optical network over a long haul. And that application for interconnecting different Metro areas is alive and well and will be for years to come. What the Cloud Xpress is, is adjacencies between data centers that are miles apart as opposed to across larger geographies. It's a whole new business opportunity for us.Michael Genovese - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionGreat. And just following up on the last question that George asked. Three months ago, you were looking ahead to now and sort of not knowing what's happened -- what was going to happen. And then obviously there's been an improvement, and it seems very broad based. But is there any more detail by -- at least talk about cable or telco, wholesale, Tier 1, whatever it is. Is there any more detail? Is there anything that strengthened more than others or -- international versus U.S., different geographies? Is there any more color or granularity there that would be helpful?Brad D. FellerSo Mike, as we've talked about before, cable tends to be -- do most of their ordering in the first half of the year. So not driven by cable. Obviously, the Internet content guys continue to grow capacity and add bandwidth to their networks. Our Tier 1 customers continue to do business with us. And customers on the bandwidth wholesaler side continue to be strong as well.Thomas J. FallonAnd international has picked up a lot.Brad D. FellerYes. And we talked about Europe being strong as well as some of the other international regions in Q3. You should expect that to continue into Q4 as well.Michael Genovese - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionAnd any surprise that you only had one 10% customer in the quarter? Was that what you expected when you were looking at Q3? Or do you think there might be 2?Brad D. FellerYes. I mean, it's typical. There's -- we normally have 1 to 2. We had 1 this quarter. It wasn't a surprise to us.OperatorOur next question comes from Sanjiv Wadhwani of Stifel.Sanjiv R. Wadhwani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research DivisionMy question is also on the results on the outlook. A couple of questions, Tom, also you've done an extremely good job in terms of growth over the last year. And then this year is also going to be 20%-plus. Any predictions on what the optical market does next year as you look into 2015?Thomas J. FallonIt's one of those -- all we do at this point is mostly listen to analyst reports, which kind of project, I think, somewhere in the 8% to 10% range. Probably, they say Metro growing a little bit faster than long haul, which they typically forecast. And sometimes that's accurate; sometimes long haul grows a little faster. I would assume the industry will grow roughly in the 8% to 10% range next year. And we anticipate -- I don't know what we'll do, and we're certainly not going to guide to that, but my commitment to the company is we're going to continue to grow faster than the market. And I have every reason to believe we will do that.Sanjiv R. Wadhwani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research DivisionGot it. That's helpful. And then, Brad, on gross margins, one of the elements that you mentioned that led to the upside was just the fills happening faster. Can you sort of walk us through what's going on there, any more detail or granularity? Is that sort of thing that you're expecting to continue for the foreseeable future? And then for Cloud Xpress, remind me what the gross margins look for -- look like for that product?Brad D. FellerSure. So the thing you're seeing related to fill activities, Sanjiv, is we're essentially at the 2-year point after the introduction of the DTN-X and just the natural momentum of customers coming back to add capacity to those networks. As we mentioned in Q3, we had several of the Internet content guys come back for additional capacity. You're now seeing customers across multiple of the verticals start to come back for additional capacity. So we're going to continue to try to grow as much footprint as we can because that will benefit us from years to come. But I do think that the momentum of the fill activity is going to continue and will continue to benefit the gross margins.David F. WelchI might add on something to Brad's comments there. I want to note that it's not -- our gross margin migration is not strictly a result of fill. It's really an acknowledgment of our differentiation within the product set. When we're growing at twice market, it's not -- it's because we have something better to offer than our competitors' products, and that will represent itself in margins.Brad D. FellerAnd then, Sanjiv, yes, to address the Cloud Xpress. So what we've talked about is some of the early, large volume orders from some of the ICP guys may be a little bit lower than corporate gross margin, but we believe over time the Cloud Xpress and that family of products will be accretive to our gross margins.OperatorOur next question comes from Alex Henderson of Needham & Company.Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionA couple of mundane things. Just wanted to make sure I got the metrics right on the customers. So how many -- can you just tell us how many customers you're currently carrying? I just want to make sure that I'm plotting it correctly.Brad D. FellerI believe the number is 131.David F. WelchIt's 139.Brad D. Feller139.Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionYes. I thought it was like 136 last quarter and you added 3. Is that not right?Brad D. FellerYes. So 139. Yes, Dave's got it right.Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionOkay. And then the DTN-X is at 49, that's correct?Brad D. FellerYes.Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionOkay, great. Just want to make sure I had those right. So in terms of a content question, the obvious parameter around 2014 has been this very large customer that you noted in 2Q and 3Q. It looks like they've re-upped again into 4Q. Does that set up a situation where we should be anticipating tough comparisons in 2Q, 3Q and 4Q next year? Or is that just the natural process of your business? And while it impacted the visibility as you went through it sequentially, it's normal comparisons as we look at it into next year?Brad D. FellerYes. So Alex, the large order that we talked about in Q2 and Q3 is largely done and built at this point. There is a lot of ports in that network that we think will grow for years to come, but that is largely done. So the strength you're seeing is across the broad customer base, which would imply that as we get into next year, we should continue to see growth across the customer base.Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionSo I shouldn't be concerned about comparisons?Brad D. FellerNo.David F. WelchNo.Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionOkay, great. And then going back to the cloud product. There's obviously any time you launch a product some startup costs associated with it. And with December launch, should we be anticipating there's some startup expenses in there that will gradually fall out as the year progresses, allowing a little bit better margin by midyear next year on that product? Or should we assume that it comes out pretty much at margin?Brad D. FellerYes. So I wouldn't expect any differentiation upfront in Q4 versus into '15.Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionGreat. And the other question is relative to the rate of activity. Have you seen a change in the rate of activity over the course of the last couple of months? It seems like it's been pretty robust all summer. You were thinking it might slow, but it doesn't look like it did. So is it reasonable to say that business is as robust as it's been all year?Brad D. FellerYes. So I think business continues to be strong, Alex. I think the pipeline activity continues to be strong. Obviously, there's been good early interest in the Cloud Xpress. So I would say it's strong. It's been strong all year.Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionThat's still early December launch for that right?Brad D. FellerYes.Thomas J. FallonIt's being launched launch FCS [ph] early December, correct.Alexander B. Henderson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionGreat. I'll cede the floor.Thomas J. FallonAnd the one comment I will make, Alex. You asked is it as strong as it's been all year. The year has seen different levels of strength. I think it's been fundamentally strong all year. I would consider currently the outlook and pipeline of activity to be good. Unlike last year, we are seeing signs that there'll be some year-end money. And while I don't particularly -- we're not baking any plans on year-end money, I think that there's a different level of spending ability in the industry when there is year-end money. And I'm seeing that dynamic much better than last year. I will provide one level of caution. Q1 is in the industry typically a pretty down quarter. We bucked that trend last year with a strong and up quarter. It is far too early to assume that, that will be a -- not an outlier event. So I'd encourage people to think about Q1 in our industry as being roughly soft, and then building on top of that, even with the backdrop of a good pipeline of activity.OperatorOur next question comes from Rod Hall of JPMorgan.Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionSo I've got a couple of questions and clarifications, I guess. The gross margin it sounds like, Brad, you're saying it's mostly mix related. But I wonder, Tom, could you comment on the pricing environment what -- if there's any change to it at all and give us any further color on pricing that you might have to add? And then I also wanted to see if you guys could give us any kind of indication on the kind of -- the number of trials that you're running at Cloud Xpress right now, the number of trials you might expect to have by the end of the year? And I might have a follow-up to that.Thomas J. FallonLet me talk a little bit. You said that a lot of it is mix. And some of the pricing advantage is mix that we're having some fill. Some of it is filling on Internet bandwidth. Some of it is just raw scale. If you look at our company and the volume that we associate with it, 2 years in a row of growing more than 20%, when you're a vertically integrated manufacturer, the flow-through of the leverage on that is really, really nontrivial. And as we continue to outgrow the market, I think that -- we've promised that our shareholders are going to have the benefit of an enhanced margin because of the incremental risk they take by being vertically integrated. We're starting to deliver on that promise. And I think as you see us continuing to scale, as we add new markets using the same infrastructure, the margin will continue to expand and allow us a consistent premium to what the market can bear. I think from a competitive position, pricing is, I would say, relatively normal. And it's one of the funny things I think about. Funny is, I don't know, odd things I think about. If you look back over the long-haul industry, a decade ago there were, what, a dozen competitors competing in the long-haul space. Today, I'd fundamentally say there's 4 people competing for the bulk of the long-haul business. That is a much more rational market than we've experienced over the last few years. I look at the Metro market today. There's, what, a dozen or 15 competitors in the Metro market. And as I see the 100-gig and the technologies moving into that Metro space, making it harder and harder for subscale people to make the required investments, I think you're going to see the same kind of shakeout over the next 5 years. Instead of a dozen Metro competitors, you'll see a half a dozen competitors. That is going to make it a much more appealing environment for those half dozen people or less that are the new winners, and I firmly believe that is Infinera's opportunity.Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionOkay. And I just -- I wanted to see if you guys also could comment on the rate of fill that you're seeing in this particular product cycle. Would you say that, that rate is faster than what you've observed in prior cycles? Maybe Tom and/or Dave could weigh in on that.David F. WelchI think you might be overemphasizing the aspects of fill. The fill rates for the quarter are normal and steady. Those are things that change at a frankly slow clip. To reemphasize what Tom stated before, really our margin expansion comes from the value we offer, the vertical infrastructure that we've developed, the scale of which we're supplying it and then fill plays a role in it. But it is not a -- our business is not driven by fill or builds. It's driven by the other values.OperatorOur next question comes from Dmitry Netis of William Blair.Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research DivisionI missed the early part of the call, so I apologize. But I wanted to see -- how many customers have lined up to buy that CX platform that you're launching in December? Can you quote a number there? Just give us sort of an overview of the customer base that you're getting here. And then I assume that the average deal size on CX would be lower, somewhat lower than the DTN-X, is that correct? I mean just walk us through sort of your assumptions there.Brad D. FellerYes. So Dmitry, it's a little too early to say on the Cloud Xpress in terms of how many customers. We haven't even ordered -- opened up formal orderability yet. We have got good feedback from customers that are evaluating the product, but given that we haven't formally opened up orderability yet, there's no metrics we can give at this point.Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research DivisionOkay, great. And then the second question would be, if you could share any color on the last sort of big wins you had, one was with XO, the other is Level 3. What the traction there has been? I mean if you color that out for us would be great.Brad D. FellerSure. So Level 3 was earlier on in the year. I would say overall it's been a little bit slower than we anticipated. I think they're a important customer, and I think they will do well over time. And as they continue to win in the market, that will be good for us. But this year, it's been a little bit slower than we anticipated. XO is a more recent win. They continue to build new routes with us, and I think will be a good customer going forward as well.OperatorOur next question comes from Subu Subrahmanyan of The Juda Group.Natarajan Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group, Research DivisionI had 2 questions. First on seasonality. Tom, you mentioned this briefly. This year you also had the benefit of a large cable customer in the first quarter, which sort of altered the seasonality. Can you talk about what you're seeing in that cable market and how cable M&A could potentially exacerbate seasonality this year, if that's a thing you worry about? My other question is on Cloud Xpress. If you could just broadly talk about what percentage of revenues you think it could represent in 2015? Could this be a 10% of revenue sort of product?Thomas J. FallonSo in regard to cable, it's just too early to ask the question, Subu. It's -- cable buys a lot in the first half of the year. We have very specific plans of what we're going to go do with cable in regard to the merger and acquisition. The last I looked I think that the 180-day review period has been put on hold by the SEC in regard to Comcast and Time Warner. So we don't know what it means yet, and it's too early to speculate. I think that we are not anticipating in Q1 having any impact by whatever happens. But in regard to a longer view of that, yes, it's just too early to tell. We can game theory it out, but I don't think it really helps a lot. In regard to what percentage of our business could Cloud Xpress be? I think it could be a very significant percentage of our business. I think it's early to break out, whether it's 10% or more. But next year being the first real year of the product, I expect a significant ramp. I think longer term it could probably be more than 10%.Natarajan Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group, Research DivisionAnd if I could follow-up on gross margin. As you mentioned some of the factors, volume, mix, given you're further along into the DTN-X cycle and then fill rate, what are the puts and takes, Brad, in terms of the factors? In the past, large footprint adds have had a depressing effect on margins. But given higher volumes, you'll get better utilization from Cloud Xpress, and also given just kind of really being later in the stage, in the 100-gig build-out cycle, what are some of the puts and takes in gross margins as you look out into the next year?Brad D. FellerYes. So as I mentioned earlier, our plan is to go -- continue to build as much footprint as we can. Obviously, the systems we deploy today can take a lot more capacity. So our shareholders should want us to continue to build a lot of footprint. And you characterized it correctly, that those initial builds have a lower margin profile. What will happen, what we expect to happen in '15 is the level of fill to continue to increase, which will balance off some of that footprint as you go through '15. But, yes, we obviously delivered 44% gross margin this quarter, and we expect to continue to grow margins over time.Operator[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brian Coyne of National Alliance Capital Markets.Brian Coyne - National Alliance Capital Markets, Research DivisionA couple of things. Tom, I got completely lost, unfortunately, in your response to Alex's question, I think, on sort of year-end money or budget flush. I was wondering if you could just help clear that up. I couldn't tell if you were saying that you saw any of that or weren't sort of attributing or saw any potential benefit from that in Q4. And then, I guess, just sort of how that extends as well into -- I know sort of the cable question came about, but if you can just sort of talk about that with regard to cable as well. And then a second one on Cloud Xpress, I'll try to ask it maybe in a different way. I know at your Analyst Day you spoke a bit about a more kind of deliberate deployment into the first half of 2015 as it might befit sort of a new product. But given the momentum you're seeing in DTN-X, is any of that sort of customer activity momentum spilling into the Metro cloud area? Could you possibly see sort of a faster pull in demand that changes that trajectory in the first half of next year?Thomas J. FallonSo let me hit the first one on the Q4, and I apologize if I was unclear earlier. I said last year we were very specific stating we did not see any year-end budget flush. We did not see year-end opportunities. I think we turned out to be correct on that. And we're given credit for kind of having an insight into that market. This year, I do see some year-end money being available. We have not baked that necessarily into our plan or commitment because it hasn't materialized yet. But I do see an environment where there is more likely than not some Q4 year-end budget flushing. And I think that to me what that means is an overall healthier market that we're selling into and other people are selling into. I think that's a positive sign for the industry. That's my only point on a budget flush. In regard to Q1, I'm encouraging people to think about the typical cyclical down quarter that there is there. And while we are, I think, having incredibly strong momentum right now across a very broad range of customers and geographies, I don't want people to assume at this point that we will be immune this year to a Q1 downturn like we were last year. I'm not saying we will have one. I'm just saying be careful of assuming we won't. In regard to cloud, I'm very careful about trying to introduce new products into the market to make sure that they meet our customers' expectation around quality, reliability, performance, software quality. We typically do, do a reasonably metered ramp into a market to make sure. Quantities of one don't prove anything. You have to build a number of units before you fully understand that the market is being satisfied by your product. Having said that, I do anticipate there'll be a fairly steep ramp in Q1 and Q2 for Cloud Xpress. Our overall demand profile of what we anticipate winning is pretty strong. And at the end of the day, we build products to satisfy demand. So if the demand does materialize, we will work very hard to ramp up that product in such a fashion that it meets not only time to volume, time to quality but also time to market and volume goals.OperatorOur next question comes from Ted Moreau of Barrington Research.Ted J. Moreau - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research DivisionKind of getting back to this Q4 versus Q1 seasonality question. If I think back to the Q2 earnings call, you guys talked about deals that you saw in the Q4, Q1 time frame. And given the strength of the guidance that we're seeing for Q4, are a bunch of these deals for Q4, Q1 largely now being pulled into Q4? Is that kind of what's happening? Or can you give some color there, please?David F. WelchMaybe I can, and I'll let Tom follow up. As indicated by our guidance, Q4 looks good. And as Tom indicated, that's based on our exposure to what the customer demand is. It's coming from a broad base of customers. Due to the same thing we've described in the past, Q1, I -- we're just not giving guidance around what Q1 is. I think you guys are trying to reach to far, too far forward. The next quarter, Q4 looks good, and we'll have to make commentary on what Q1 looks like at the end of Q4.Thomas J. FallonI think it's important to understand we are not trying to ramp up a Q4 by pulling in fundamental demand from Q1. I'm a big believer as a company keeping things as natural as possible allows you to run a healthy, normal business. And we are not trying to accelerate demand from Q1 into Q4. If anything, if Q4 end of year money becomes available, our challenge might be quite frankly being able to take that because the demand profile of our business right now is robust -- and surprise things at the end of the year, sometimes you can't -- if you're already full, you're already full. So that's a challenge.David F. WelchAnd maybe I can add one other comment here. Understand, our customer base is predominantly the customers that carry the traffic of the Internet. We are not highly dictated by wireless bandwidth. This is the bandwidth that drives the high-capacity pipes and the data center types of activities out there. That background demand and the growth of that background demand is driven by the same processes that are out there that drive whether it's consumer consumption, business consumption, cloud -- moving your IT systems to the cloud. That trend is a strong trend, and that's why we're experiencing this across our set of diversified customer base.Thomas J. FallonI agree. I think fundamental growth of Internet demand and new sources of network architectures to deal with the cloud, data center, et cetera, just create a great backdrop for us and other people in the industry.And I think that's our last question. Thank you for joining us this afternoon and for your questions. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress. Have a great day.OperatorThis concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.")
# 2014 q4
infn.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorAll right, thank you. [Operator Instructions] All right, our first"
            " question comes from Michael Genovese from MKM Partners. Sir you have an open line.Michael GenoveseGreat, thanks very much. And congratulations on a great quarter as well as a very nice prepared remarks.I guess my first question is, it sounds like there was no Cloud Xpress revenue in the quarter so is that right? And can you help us think about how much revenue there might be in the first quarter from that product like would it be bigger than a bread basket?Brad FellerYeah, so Mike the revenue in Q4 was relatively small. There was some revenue but it was relatively small. We just launched it in December, so there was a couple of shipments in Q4. We expect that to ramp up in Q1, but we’re not going to break out that specific number on Q1.Michael GenoveseOkay.OperatorThank you. And our next question comes from George Notter from Jefferies. Sir, I’m sorry. Our next question comes from Simona Jankowski from Goldman Sachs. Ma’am, you have an open line.Simona JankowskiHi, thank you. I think you mentioned that you have an exceptional backlog into the New Year. Can you share with us what that is in order to reportable number?Brad FellerYes, it’s north of $100, Simona.Simona JankowskiOkay. Thank you. And for cloud, well, for your first quarter guidance, is the strength driven more by DTN-X or by Cloud Xpress?Brad FellerYes, the reality, Simona, it’s across the board. So we are seeing strength in several of the different verticals. We do expect Cloud Xpress to start to ramp in Q1 as well, so it’s a combination of both.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Rod Hall from JP Morgan. Sir, you have an open line.Rod HallYes. Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. First, I wanted to ask you on the services revenue, it sounds like the installation services mainly. Could you helps us understand what the gross margin impact of that increase was, is that a negative gross margin impact then it’s more than offset by the scaling on the vertical model, or is it actually helping gross margin as well?And then I also - I don’t know quite how to cover this question, but there is a lot of press around about a major metro deal, I’m sure, you guys anticipated questions on the call here. What I would like to get you to do, Tom, maybe is, you talked a lot about your metro position and yet up to this point, some of the new Tier 1 deals that are out there, you guys have not managed to win even know it seems like you’ve got a really good product offering.So can you talk to us a little bit about what you think you need to do to position yourself or maybe the next one of those coming down the pike? Thanks.Brad FellerLet me address the first part of the question, Rod, and then I will let, Tom, address the second part. So the services margins were relatively flat order-over-quarter. They don’t necessarily get the benefit from the vertical integration. The team has done a good job of continuing to be more efficient with those installations, but the overall services margins were flat quarter-over-quarter.Rod HallOkay, thanks, Brad.Thomas FallonSo in regard, Rod, to a large metro RFQ, I’m going to start by saying first of all, there are a lot of large metro RFQs right now, and I know which one you are referring to, but I think it’s important to put in context. We are seeing a tremendous opportunities in metro, metro cloud in particular right now, and they are of a tremendous scale. And I think, the industry continues to still focus too much on a couple of Tier 1s and what they are doing as the proxy for the industry. And I continue to remind people that that is an antiquated view, they still spend a lot of money, but there are huge architectural shifts and shifts in who is building large networks, both long-haul and metro.In regard to the Tier 1, one, I’m sure you are referring to, we are actually not participating in that RFQ. We have an outstanding portfolio, we are bringing our metro aggregation product to market as we talked about later this year, but it is not one that is going to be in time for what they’re looking for now.Rod HallDo you feel, Tom, do you feel like, you’ve got the distribution logistics capability to support these guys just one of the big tick boxes for them, I mean, is there any issue from a scale point of view, you feel like, you need that to add to be in a good position on some of those RFQs?Thomas FallonNo, I would be as candid as I usually am. I think our operational execution are on manufacturing, distribution, service and support is as good or better than anybody in the industry. We have never had a customer of any scale. We had $100 million a year accounts, including last year, and they think we are the best planet - a vendor on the planet. So I don’t think that there is anybody that will challenge or make us not participate because of issues around scalability, service support, or distribution.David WelchI think it’s worth reiterating and pointing out from a long haul capability, we are the leader, in that context, we are - as recognized by our customers as the leader for optical transport gear.Rod HallGreat. Okay, thanks, guys.Brad FellerYou bet, Rod.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Sanjiv Wadhwani from Stifel. Sir, you may - sir, you have an open line.Sanjiv WadhwaniThanks. Two questions; first on the Cloud Xpress, obviously understanding that revenues in Q4 were very small, and I’m trying to gauge whether as you’ve gone through some of the trials and some of the orders have started to come through, if you can give us a flavor of how large some of these deals are compared to sort of, what you would call traditional long-haul deals?And then second, Tom, just a broad industry question. Any comments around net neutrality title two [ph], any discussions with your customers around that that leads you to believe that spending could be quote unquote volatile as the year progresses? Thank you.Thomas FallonYes. So regard to Cloud Xpress, we are seeing demand from a number of different customers, certainly the large ICPs, we are seeing demand from. We are also experiencing demand international customers, small-scale to-date, but we are very excited that early on. We are already seeing orders coming in from Asia. We also have picked up, at least one, maybe two enterprise customers through a new channel for us, a company quite frankly that I was unaware of it before as an end-user, and they are building networks to support the education market.So one of our expectations with this product was that, it would be broadly adopted by, both large-scale, very small people deploying cloud architectures and so far early in, I believe our intuition was correct. One of the things that we are seeing on this and it was a little bit of a surprise to me is the certification process that we are seeing is a little bit longer than I had anticipated. I assumed most people would take this and pretty much throw holy water on it and put it in a network.What we are seeing actually is some pretty rigorous testing by the large guys, and I actually take this as good news. It might delay a little bit of the ramp, but I believe they are doing this testing, because they are not viewing this as a tactical solution to a today cloud probable, but in architectural solution to a future network architecture. And that means that that when they deploy and scale, it will be large-scale and it will be for a long time.The third thing to remember is that, we’ve introduced our 40 gig interface to-date. We are introducing and that was driven by a specific ICPs who had a specific problem that they wanted to solve and they are actually buying it, and we are deploying that. The second generation or the second product will be coming out this quarter, that’s a 10 gig interface, which will open up a whole lot of a larger market for us. And then we have a third product coming out this summer, which is a 100 gig interface. And we see lots and lots of demand starting to build up for people wanting to deploy this architecture with a 100 gig later this year, matter of fact, they are putting pressure on us to deliver it earlier.So I’m actually very delighted with the progress to-date on the cloud. It has been shipping for just over 30 days, and we continue to see a pipeline of activity that is growing across multiple verticals and down to customers that historically we’ve never been able to touch. I think, we do have some continued work to do to expand our partner program. We’ve always had kind of a sell with model and with this type of product we have to have a sell-through model, and we are winding up those partners today and training them. And I think that that will start having impact over the next few quarters.On net neutrality finally. I’m - we certainly poke [ph] at this. I think that I’m a fundamental opponent as Infinera of government coming in and trying to regulate something that quite frankly in my mind isn’t broken. And second of all telling people who are putting at risk capital to work how they can earn a fair return on that. As I’ve talked to our customers most of them are in the same position that we are, and one of the things that we all agree on, it’s not going to stop bandwidth demand.I think, some large-scale people who are worried about how they get paid might delay some of their capital expenditure and expansion until there are some resolution, I think getting a resolution is very important. But the customers I have talked to to-date do not believe regulation is a good answer, but they are not stopping deployment as bandwidth demands continue to increase. Does that answer your question Sanjiv?OperatorAll right. Our next question comes from Mr. George Notter from Jefferies. Sir, you have an open line.George NotterHi, thanks very much, guys, and congratulations again on the quarter in the guidance and the strength of the business. I guess, I wanted to kind of dig in some more on Cloud Xpress. So, I think you said earlier, you still have to deliver 100 gig interface in Cloud Xpress, there is a 40 gig interface as well. I mean, can you just help me understand kind of where you are in terms of the feature set? It sounds like there still are some important features you guys need to deliver and so if I’m going to see the ramp in that product. And then I also would like to know, kind of what you are selling against in terms of Cloud Xpress. I see most of the applications here are intra-datacenter. Are you selling against single mode fiber or multimode fiber? Single wavelength applications or are there other competitors in the WDM space you’re seeing? Kind of walk us through what you’re competing against here competitively. Thanks.David WelchSo yes, the - George, let me take a shot at that. First off, you got to understand where market demand is to start with. The market demand is - the largest market demand as we indicated, as we chose the release sequence of our product is for 40 gig interfaces. And that’s the largest part of the market that’s running on. It’s a 40 gig - it’s driven by the interfaces that have intra inside the data center to interface to that.The second product which will be coming out basically right on its heels will have a 10 gigabit interface to it. Those two interfaces are chosen because that is by far the lion’s share of interfaces that you need to couple to into - in looking back into the data center. 100 gigabit Ethernet interfaces aren’t anywhere near the norm inside a data center at this point, and - but we do expect that to be a second half of 2015, 2016 momentum trend for these types of boxes.So I don’t believe we are missing out on any businesses because of having our 100 gigabit Ethernet interface not available till summer-ish time. That was driven - so there is not a - there is a normal release cycle for - to get the features out when the customers need it. We think we’re well timed and I’m not aware of any business that we are losing because of that sequence of product.Relative to what do we compete against, for the two high-capacity links between data centers, it is a DWDM market. It is a single mode market. They need terabits of capacity interconnecting data centers. That is something that on the whiteboard. You might be able to solve with lots of fibers but operationally and logistically it is a nightmare. If they can solve it with single mode fiber and with WDM solutions, they absolutely will. And so it’s - I don’t find ourselves competing against non-DWDM solutions in that.There are certainly other competitors that have positioned their product in there, but one of the key things that our customers are interested in is density, power consumption, quality, simplicity. They want to be able to take just like they do with the rest of their data centers, to be able to take a rack-and-stack approach, get high density interfaces within a rack, have a very simple, very fast turn-up and let the virtual machines run away. And we have a distinct advantage over other competitive product in that space.Brad FellerIn almost all those attributes, space, power, scalability, the whole thing, ease of use, all of it.George NotterYes, great. Thanks very much guys.Thomas FallonSure.OperatorThank you. And our next question comes from Mr. Dmitry Netis from William Blair. Sir, you have an open line.Dmitry NetisThank you, guys. Clean quarter, thank you very much for that. Couple of questions on the geo kind of breakdowns and some of the foreign-exchange issues we are seeing across-the-board. Can you - it’s about 30% of the business, any impact that you foresee coming into the 2015 from foreign exchange? That is number one.Number two, you won a Tier 1 in Russia I believe, I think it was Rostelecom that you announced last year. Is there any traction there? Are you seeing any progress on that front? And then the Tier 1 that you had, the 10% Tier 1 you have here in North America, is that coming back meaningfully in Q1 as well?And then maybe last one if I may, just if you can give us an update on Level 3 and XO which you have announced last year, how do you foresee them tracking throughout 2015? Thank you.Brad FellerDmitry, so on the FX side of things, we do have some impact from currency but it’s nothing that’s material to the results. So we continue to watch it and there are some challenges more with the timing of payments and getting cash out of certain countries, but nothing that is materially impacting the results.From a Russia perspective there is a - we still see a lot of opportunity there. Obviously the events of the past several months have caused us to be even more cautious but we think longer-term there is still a good opportunity for us there inside of Russia.Thomas FallonYes, in regard to level - and I agree. Yes, I think we see a lot of opportunity in Russia and we are quoting a number of things, but we are walking cautiously as I think they and we are experiencing a world that nobody anticipated and we have to make sure that there is an ability to get paid. And we are going to be careful on that.On Level 3 and XO both of them are significant customers this last year. Both of them continued to have robust business with us. I think we are exceptionally well-positioned with both of them and we anticipate that they will have strong years with us. Obviously they don’t forecast beyond kind of current POs and a little bit into the next quarter. But so far it looks like it will start out with them strong.In regard to our North America Tier 1 it was an exceptional year with them last year and we anticipate that we are going to continue to have good opportunity with them this year. What the whole year will look like? I don’t know, but I do anticipate that they will continue to build a reasonable amount of network with us.Dmitry NetisThank you.Thomas FallonYeah.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham. Sir, you have an open line.Alex HendersonGreat. Thank you very much. Wish I had stayed a little longer on this one.Thomas FallonI’m glad you said it to keep me from saying it, Alex.Alex HendersonYes, well, sometimes you get them right; sometimes you get them wrong, [indiscernible]. So maybe you can address a couple of the issues that got me nervous, so that I could get un-nervous on those issues.So the first one was, you had a big spike in the demand conditions in 2Q and 3Q of 2014. Should we be considering that a tough compare as we go into that window? Or do you view that as more of a kind of a normal backdrop that was just robust and it stayed so robust subsequently that we should just ignore that as a compare? Can I smooth that out in my mind or should I be worried about it?Thomas FallonWell, I never look at any one quarter to get kind of a sense. Our lumpy - our business from the outside in looks pretty smooth. We have done a good job I think of working with customers and linearizing [ph] our revenue growth, but the bookings come-in in a fairly lumpy fashion. And I think Q2 in our business is usually a strong bookings quarter and it’s too early to say that it will be a strong bookings quarter this year. Q1 looks robust. We’re carrying as Brad said a very big backlog into Q1.Q2 is, like I said, historically a good bookings quarter and Q3 is historically not a strong bookings quarter, as a lot of Europe shuts down and even in North America there’s a lot of holiday I think that attributes to slowdowns, plus with strong Q1 in - or Q2 sometimes you have to digest that inventory before you make your next purchase order, so I always kind of look at it as a Q2 plus Q3.It’s way too early to talk about even Q2 but certainly Q3. But I do see fairly robust demand cycles in the short and intermediate term for this year. I am very optimistic that our business with all the verticals we’re in looks pretty strong right now. We clearly ended the year with strong international business which was different than the first half of last year and a number of analysts are starting to forecast a recovery in Europe or in Asia. And eventually, candidly they will be right eventually because it is just an under-spend that occurred and I think we are well-positioned in those markets assuming they don’t have tragic economic issues there.So I am pretty optimistic on the year and I would encourage you not to focus on any one quarter as a tell [ph] of the overall business direction. I view kind of the rolling two quarter average as the right kind of sense for how the business is going.Alex HendersonGreat. And the second question is, I know you are targeting about 20% of revenues to R&D, but you usually have spikes in prototyping costs. Can you talk about whether there would be individual prototyping events around some of these new interfaces which I hadn’t been expecting but more importantly around the MetroCor product as we get to the back of the year?Thomas FallonWell, in any quarter something can happen in R&D that either pushes out or accelerates a little bit. But we have been pretty consistent, Alex, on hitting kind of the number. And actually if you look at last year we ran more like 19% or little under in R&D because as our revenue ramped we had a hard time scaling R&D expenses to that level.Obviously with us going into this New Year, we’re ramping up R&D again, and our expectation is it might be a challenge to get to that 20% number, but if we exceed in any quarter. I am kind of philosophically bent, it’s not going to be over 20%, and it will be a small overage that we would explain as a one-time and then we would make it up, because I don’t think we should spend more than 20% in R&D.Alex HendersonGot it. And the last question, could you talk about the capacity availability in your plan, obviously getting a nice leverage of the spectacular growth you are producing. I had thought, you guys have done a fabulous job. But where are we on capacity availability and cost needed to build capacity or incremental testing or what have you around that?Thomas FallonDave will answer this question, but I want to assure you, Alex, if you want some, I’ll make them available for you.David WelchAll right. I mean, the capacity model that we have is very resilient to this - the growth of the business be it in the PIC fab, there is lots of space to continue to both gain leverage, as well as increase the capacity of the system, the economics of expanding capacity or more of a tool by tool there. So we are way short of any type of major factory redo on that. The rest of our supply chain is very well-managed - multisource managed that we can be able to accommodate any anticipated demand changes there.Brad FellerYes, the other thing I would add is, the guys that run our facilities internally do a great job of driving down test times and cost of the fab, increasing yields, just kind of stuff. So we continue to add capacity through that mechanism every quarter as well.Thomas FallonIf you look at last year we ran, our model for CapEx is about 5% of revenue except every five or six years we have to bump that up to 7% or so. Last year we ran it 4%, so even with that relatively phenomenal growth over the last two years, we ran it 4% last year. And as Brad and Dave both said, we don’t anticipate going over 5% again this year.Alex HendersonKnockabout guys, good job. Thanks.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Subu Subrahmanyan from The Juda Group. Sir, you have an open line.Subu SubrahmanyanThank you. I have two questions. First on the year, Tom, you mentioned growing faster than the market, growing 8% to 9%, obviously, you would be growing significantly faster than that. Just wondering, if you could talk about some of the puts and takes, which allowed you to grow at double-digit pace of the market and whether those kinds of growth rates are in excess of the market are sustainable.The other you did comment on consolidation potentially causing near-term issues. We know in the cable space, there is a large one and despite that you’ve had strong first quarter guidance. Could you talk about what you are seeing in the cable M&A in terms of the impact on your business?Thomas FallonSo in regard to growth why are we growing, I think, it’s for a number of reasons. One, it goes back to a little bit of the Infonetics Research when they query customers on who is the best supplier. And it’s a plethora of things like technology, it’s lead time, it’s quality, it’s ease-of-use. I truly believe our system solution is significantly and demonstrably better than our customer - our competitors.The second part I think is, we have done a good job of focusing on customers who are building the biggest networks in the future, whether it’s Internet content providers or people that we used to refer to as wholesalers, international Tier 1s, who are building competitive businesses in the international markets. We are building very substantial networks and they operate at a much faster cadence than the traditional Tier 1s. So I think that, those are some of the things that are driving our historic growth.I think that moving forward, as I mentioned in the call, as we go into the metro cloud and we go into metro aggregation, we are going to between double and triple the size of the market that we are serving over the next several years. And I think we are going to do that with the customers that we already have. We are going to add to that new customers and go into markets that we have historically not provided solutions. And we are going to use the same differentiated technology that we’ve used to win in the long-haul in those markets.So I think, is it sustainable? I’m not going to say that 20% is our target for any given year. But I think our growth of outpacing the market growth is sustainable for a long time. And I’m committed to doing that, and I don’t believe if there is any reason, we can’t outgrow the market for the next several years as we enter into these new markets.In regard to consolidation and the specific one in the cable space, it’s too early to call. As you know, we have one customer that’s a significant Infinera customer and the other one is not an Infinera customer. That can certainly cause a delay, but I think that all the right things are happening to create an opportunity for us in this merged network - this merged company. But those companies are still independent entities and they’re operating that way until a merger is approved and done.And the best I can tell that is, that continues to slip out a little. So right now, we are doing the appropriate things with the current customer of satisfying their network needs as they build new network. And we are working with the other customer to explain our value proposition and we are making reasonable progress there. But it’s too early to have an insight into what it’s going to mean after it’s done.Subu SubrahmanyanGot it. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Scott Thompson with Wedbush Securities. Sir, you have an open line.Scott ThompsonThank you. Hey, guys, it’s great quarter, wanted to ask a couple of questions. Over the last couple of quarters, we’ve been talking a bit about growing channels, sales channels into other geographies, it looks like that’s starting to pay off especially in Europe this quarter, with the economy is still kind of sputtering over there, what do you attribute the growth in Europe, and the demand over there too? I would say, people building out in country networks, or is that other growth drivers? And then I’ve got a follow-up or two after that.Thomas FallonSo I think in Europe it’s driven by a couple of things. One, it’s just like the rest of the world, there is just fundamental demand for bandwidth. Now, second of all a lot of our demand is coming from two aspects. One is international carriers who are building competitive networks, pan-European competitive networks, and that’s a competitive business and you have to put the capacity in place to be able to attract and grow customers.The second part is, we’ve been very successful with some government-sponsored networks in Europe, education and research networks. I think part of it is, because they view us as both very easy to use, but also cutting-edge technology, which appeals to them for the scalability of the networks. We are also experiencing very good growth in Latin America and that’s through some new channel partners that have global reach. And I anticipate that this new channel is going to allow us to continue to have good success in Latin America, I think with the areas where we need to continue to develop more depth of partnership is in APAC.We are very successful there with submarine customers, but most of those are direct. I think with our new Cloud Xpress, we see early indications that our partners there are going to have this as a product that they can sell well into that market. We’ve already gotten some attraction there with some commitments, but we have a lot of opportunity still to grow through partners there.Scott ThompsonAll right. And then can you compare and contrast the 100 gig long-haul market in the U.S. versus Europe. Are we in earlier stages in Europe, or is it somewhere, can you kind of give us an idea where we are at in that upgrade cycle and with your customer base in those Europe and the U.S.?David WelchSure, maybe I can add into that. I would say, one of the areas that certainly the ICP market has grown preferentially in North America - initially in North America, and we have gone through and seen a significant growth phase there. It hasn’t growth at same rate in Europe where we anticipated that it will. The data center utilization, the movement of the - due to cloud et cetera is going to become stronger and stronger, but it’s initiated first in North America then it’s going to move over to Europe. So we - I think, there is a lot of growth left and bandwidth growth in Europe going forward.Thomas FallonOne of the things I agree, the ICP architecture is probably six months or a year ahead in North America, maybe a little more. I also see a 100 gig services, so 100 gig waves carrying a transmission in Europe, I think, it has become the standard. And we are just now seeing them starting to have the inflection point of a 100 gig services coming of that, it’s been vastly 10 gig, and that’s probably six months or so after we started seeing that in North America. But we do see a lot of opportunity for 100 gig interfaces moving forward both in APAC and Europe in the next year, and that’s relatively new.David WelchAnd a lot of that data center interconnect is going to cross country boundaries in that, and so it’s going to depend a lot on the international carriers for that interconnection.Scott ThompsonOkay. And then any comments on service provider carrier over there?David WelchWe are doing well there. I mean, the international part of our business with those guys is strong. We have some very good partnerships. They’ve been both long-term partnerships and some relatively new ones. But we’re seeing good demand and they like us a lot.Scott ThompsonOkay. So we’ll pull all this back together, sales and marketing, there it sounds like there are some accelerators in there, does that drop back in first quarter, was that mostly end of your stuff, or do these new channels and developments internationally push those numbers a little bit higher moving forward?Thomas FallonYes, it’s - you will see the actual accelerators obviously come off from the first quarter. That’s said we are investing in new channels we announced the government team, we’re going to invest in that team, continue to invest in the cloud and content team. So you got two things going either way, but it shouldn’t necessarily grow significantly quarter-to-quarter.Scott ThompsonAppreciate it. Thank you, guys.OperatorAll right. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Ted Moreau with Barrington Research. Sir, you have an open line.Ted MoreauThank you and congrats guys on another great quarter. Just a couple of very quick questions here, DSOs didn’t come down in the quarter. I was kind of anticipating that they might have after, I thought last quarter or at the beginning of Q4 you are supposed to collect on a pretty big accounts-receivable so just wondering what is going on there. Is that a result of more international bend to the sales mix or can you comment there?Thomas FallonYeah, no, it’s really just the timing of things. So you are right, there was a big item hanging out there at theend of last quarter. But with the pressure to get things in the quarter some of it was towards the last 45 days to 60 days of the quarter which ends up in AR at the end of the quarter. The aging is very solid though so nothing to be concerned about from that perspective.Ted MoreauOkay. And then, I mean historically we talked about the line card sale mix and the impact on the gross margin. Can you just kind of walk us through maybe how you’re seeing that play out throughout the course of 2015 as - I mean I thought 2015 was likely to be a pretty high line card year, but it sounds like you’ve got a lot of opportunities to continue to expand market share, so could you walk us through that?Thomas FallonYeah, so we do expect 2015 to have more and more customers come back to take additional capacity through the traditional line card model, but also through in some bandwidth. That said, we do expect to continue to grow a lot of footprint this year. There is still a tremendous amount of new networks being built. So it’s going to be a combo of those different things throughout the year is our expectation.Brad FellerWe do expect 2015 to start having any higher percentage of fill, and but the longer that we can sell more footprint the better off we are long-term, particularly as we’re doing this while enhancing margin and creating more cash. So I am hoping that quite frankly, the fill percentage remains roughly the same as we put out lot of new footprint out, but we’re expecting a little bit more fill.Ted MoreauOkay. And then, one final one, share count continues to go up pretty quickly and then now you commented on that related to the share price. But should we expect the share count to continue to grow at a pretty substantial clip year-over-year throughout the year?Brad FellerYeah, I mean the thing that is really driving it up is just the higher stock price, so more things being dilutive. We do watch the share count all the time in terms of what we give out. So it’s just the aspect of having the higher share price puts more options in the money.Ted MoreauOkay, thanks. Congrats again, guys.Thomas FallonThank you very much, Ted.OperatorThank you. And our next question comes from Brian Coyne with National Alliance Capital Markets. Sir, you have an open line.Brian CoyneHi, guys. Thanks very much for taking my questions.Thomas FallonYou bet.Brian CoyneFirst one, real quick, if you could perhaps help me understand a little bit more about your history in the government vertical. I know you obviously had the recent announcement of the sales team and you just said that two of the international new customers were both [indiscernible]. Can you just help me understand a little bit better about sort of what those deals look like, are they currently different from a size and margin standpoint and perhaps a little bit of the outlook into 2015? And then I have a follow-up for Dave, if I could.Thomas FallonYeah, we’ve often sold into government-sponsored networks around the world. We’ve got them in England. We’ve got them in Australia, I believe. We’ve got them in North America, and Europe. These are networks that have historically been sold by our current sales team, and that’s been a good growing business for us. It’s one that we see a lot of opportunity particularly in North America. Moving forward we had a large win last year into a government network in North America. And I think it’s been one that we have underserved and I think that by focusing on it, I am a big believer in creating vertical focus like we have historically done with cable and now with ICP and government, and I think this is an area where Infinera, I probably should have done this a year ago, but I think it’s where we can grow a strong base of business over a long period of time and create - I think incremental competition to people who have been selling in there probably too easily.And we’re going to kind of fix that for them. And I think this is one where we have to have some patience. The government can buy a lot. They are very, I think, loyal customers, but it should be considered a slow sale. And I think we will have success there this year but we’re mostly going to be building a foundation for long-term success and I am excited about what we can do there.Brian CoyneIt’s very helpful. Thanks. And then, Just for Dave real quick. Going back through some of the - my notes from the slides from the Insight Infinera day back last September, I am just wondering if you could also put in perspective sort of the opportunity within the mega data centers, just I’m - sort of based upon my understanding of it so far it seems like for Cloud Xpress it’s really about high volumes, lower ASPs than DTN-X and how that works. And this is again something that goes on to most or all of the racks and as a two RU unit it sort of stood on top of every rack inside a data center. And I guess, it kind of goes little bit back to an earlier question about just - I mean, it’s Alex’s question about the scalability just in terms of addressing the market and your production.David WelchYes, so the primary application we satisfy at this point in the data center interconnect, be the CO [ph] oriented data centers or mega data center, it’s really the last box to leave the building. There are two optical interconnects that are on this, an Intra-datacenter which are top of the rack all connected through crossbar - effective crossbar switches, and then there is the aggregation of the traffic that needs to leave the building off on to the WDM line.What we are satisfying with this current product is the exit of the building product. And in very, very generic forms it is 70/30, 80/20 type of scenario that a lot of traffic stays inside, some traffic goes outside type of scenario. As the virtual machines expand beyond the capacity of individual data centers, and as the cloud moves in there further into or as your IT infrastructure moves further into the cloud, the more need for these virtual machines to reach across buildings, then that ratio is going to go up and more bandwidth will be required to interconnect the data centers. Hopefully that is helpful.Brian CoyneYeah, it is. Thanks a lot.Thomas FallonGuys, thanks for you joining us this afternoon and for all you questions. We look forward to updating you on our progress through the rest of the year. Have a great day.OperatorAnd that concludes today’s conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.")
# 2015 q1
infn.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come"
            " from George Notter of Jefferies.George NotterI wanted to ask about the Cloud Xpress platform, I think on the monologue here you guys were talking about eight customers I think you said invoice – sorry, seven invoice customers and I think that included the top three ICPs, but I think those numbers were actually similar when you guys talked about Cloud Xpress traction coming out of Q4. Can you kind of tell us what’s going on there, is this may be an apple to oranges comparison and I’m kind of missing that but kind of talk about why those customer numbers haven’t really moved that much?Tom FallonOkay, George, its Tom. It was seven customers and that’s the customers that are per our normal recognition of revenue. Last time when it was -- since it had just been launched we’ve said we are going to kind of one time talk about a combination of commitment which could be PO, it could be a contract, it could have been any kind of commitment they have made plus field trails and lab trials. So it was a kind of an aggregation of showing overall early receptivity and now we’re moving back to our more traditional where we’re going to talk about customers that have been invoiced.So we’re actually pretty happy with our how these products been received into the market. Seven customers, three big ICPs, which I think it, can drive a lot of demand. You are -- also we have announced two that would be the key through channels which are fitting a whole tier of customer that we’ve never been able to directly sell to before and I think that’s another long term type of seeds that we are planting but I think the channel infrastructure will allow us to approach and address customers that on our own we couldn’t before and I think it’s great for us to have a sell-through model with partners now instead of a sell-with.We’ve also introduced now our 10 GigE in addition to our 40 GigE. As I talked about last time 40 GigE is a smaller portion of the market that we brought that the market first at the request of a specific large ICP; 10 gig now will offer the ability to go between a larger portion of the market probably three times larger than 40 gig market or more five times. And then a 100 gig, there is a lot of interest in the 100 gig platform as people are evaluating this architecture number of them have comeback very favorable but they are inclined to wait for a 100 gig and deploy it when it comes out later this year since its going to be coming up relatively soon.That’s probably a long-winded answer to your question.George NotterYes, okay. And then can you talk about what percentage of the revenue stream this quarter came from Cloud Xpress? Is that a number you can give us?Brad FellerYes. So George, as we done traditionally we’ll give color on the number of customers, the types of customers but probably refrain from breaking it out specifically.George NotterOkay. Is there a threshold where you might to start that break that out, is it 10% of sales or how do you think about that?Brad FellerYes, it’s probably higher than that, George. And we’ll monitor it as we go forward.George NotterGot it, okay. Got it. And then I guess I wanted to also ask about your backlog this quarter. So I mean obviously you guys don’t give a backlog every quarter it’s just a year end on the K but is it fair to say that book to bill improved and it was greater than one and backlog grew this quarter; how do you characterize that?Brad FellerYes, George, we don’t break-out the backlog on a quarterly basis. We obviously came into the year with a very strong backlog but we don’t update on that on a quarterly basis.George NotterOkay, great, thank you very much.Tom FallonThanks, George.OperatorOur next question will come from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs.Simona JankowskiYes, hi. Just wanted to clarify couple of things on Cloud Xpress. Are the three ICPs referenced the same ones asked the ones you have talked about before being three of the top four?Tom FallonYes. I think two of them are the same as one as before and one is a different one, is how it's broken out so far.Simona JankowskiOkay, that one is that a previous customer or is that a new customer to Cloud Xpress.Brad FellerIt’s a previous customer that we had.Simona JankowskiGot that. And then can you also clarify the comment you made on Cloud Xpress being consistent with the current sell-side estimate; what is that range that you are referring to?Tom FallonSo I think the range, Simona, is somewhere between $30 million and $60 million is what people have told me they have in their models.Simona JankowskiOkay. And then on the Transmode acquisition, clearly the impetus there is one of revving the synergies and term expansion, but is there an opportunity for cost synergies just from the perspective of having some duplicative spend perhaps in the metro area or do you view that as purely additive spend in terms of their portfolio and their roadmap on metro versus yours?Tom FallonThis is vastly about revenue synergy and the ability to aggressively grow our portfolio, our customer presence, cross-selling and geographic dispersing of strengths. There is a cost opportunity to put our pick into appropriate parts of their platforms over time that would reduce the cost structure of their platform. But from an overall the headcount, this is really about revenue synergies; there might be some small overlap but it’s really going to be rounding here.Simona JankowskiSure. And then just last one for me, given the big move we had in FX this quarter and obviously you had a very strong quarter in the US and Europe is not as big for you, but what impact of, if any, are you seeing in terms of your customer behaviour given the big move we’ve had?Brad FellerYes, I wouldn’t say, Simona, we’ve seen a big difference in customer behaviour. I think at the end of the day the bandwidth demands on their network continue to be strong, and so it doesn’t have an overall -- we haven’t seen an overall big impact on our business.Simona JankowskiGreat. Thanks very much.Tom FallonThanks, Simona.OperatorOur next question comes from Sanjiv Wadhwani of Stifel.Sanjiv WadhwaniThanks. I had but one quick follow-up on Simona’s question, Brad. What percentage of your revenues are not based on US dollar? And the broader question I had was last year you had a big tier-1 deployment in Q2 and Q3 and I’m just curious as to when you look at it Q2 guidance which you are signalling pretty strong year-over-year growth, is there a particular type or types of customers that are coming in to offset that year-over-year tough comp and I think you refer to specifically there was some sort of big builds that were pushed out from Q1 to Q2? Maybe you can give some flavor as to what types of customers those were?Brad FellerSure. So Sanjiv on the mix in terms of FX, it differs from quarter-to-quarter but it’s roughly 10% of our overall sales are in non-USD. So it’s a relatively small percentage of our overall revenues.In terms of the Q2 guidance, unlike last year where we had the very large build from one customer, this year the strength is broader. As you know, the cable vertical tends to be stronger in the first half of the year, but the strength is across cable, it’s across the ICPs, it’s across the tier-1s, the enterprise and bandwidth wholesalers. So it is much broader than it was last year that we saw in Q2.Sanjiv WadhwaniAny color, Brad, on the push outs from Q1 to Q2 in terms of the builds; is that like a one or two customers or there are a bunch of them in the pipeline?Brad FellerNo, it’s just a couple of reasonably big networks that were right at the tail end of the quarter that didn’t quite get accepted at the end of the quarter, and so they are getting accepted in Q2.Sanjiv WadhwaniSo the deployments have been done, this is merely sort of acceptance?Brad FellerYes.Sanjiv WadhwaniOkay. Got it. Thanks.OperatorOur next question will come from Alex Henderson of Needham.Alex HendersonYes, a couple of questions on the competitive side. So as you look at your competitors on the international front, are any of them offering their pricing strategies based on the change in FX? And do you see Lucent -- or do you see ALU as the manufacturer, and I ask it that way in the sense is the cost structure for ALU more a U.S. denominated cost structure, is it blended? How do you think about that relative to those that particular competitor?Brad FellerYes, candidly, I don’t have enough understanding of how their business runs on FX and their cost structures. So I think I’m just the wrong guy to ask and you should probably ask those guys. We’re seeing is a relatively normal pricing environment, we see normal kind of cost reductions; Alcatel has historically been a pretty aggressive person in the market particularly in Europe though it seems like they’re not being quite as aggressive as they historically have been.Alex HendersonNo change there in fact may be even less competitive, or less aggressive?Brad FellerI don’t know if they’re less aggressive may be there is a new leader that’s putting the price down some more right -- I always focus on kind of who is creating the most challenge. They had historically done that, lesser right now.Alex HendersonAnd on the build push outs, what kind of scale are we talking about there? I mean is that bigger than a breadbox impact on the quarter-to- quarter and is it something that we should be nervous about sequentially as we go from 2Q to 3Q or how does that lump in?Brad FellerYes, so Alex it's not a tremendously large number it's just, because of its footprint it can move the needle on the gross margin side of things. So it was more intended to talk about why Q1 margin was a bit higher and it's coming down a little bit in Q2. It's not an overly significant number from a revenue perspective or anything you should worry about in comparables or anything like that.Alex HendersonAnd then finally the last question is, and you elaborate to is the margin side of the equation. How much of the improvement of margin is a function of service/line card sales or should we read into it that may be you're getting pretty good margins on the Cloud Xpress line, is that any read through on the Cloud Xpress margin profile?Brad FellerYes. So Alex we're not going to break out the margins on Cloud Xpress. It is the combination of things. We continue to drive down our cost structure and leverage our vertical integration. We are seeing as we've talked about for several quarters now more mix going to capacity ads, including people buying follow-on Cloud Xpress licenses and then the services side some of the deployments were more efficient so better profitability there.Alex HendersonOne last thing, any comment on liquid bandwidth uptake? Thanks.Brad FellerYes, so instant bandwidth continues to be a good program for us. I think it provides a great level of flexibility for our customers. As we've talked about before it's not the largest customers in the world and the largest routes but it continues to be an attractive portion of the portfolio.Alex HendersonSuper. Thank you.Operator[Operator Instructions].Our next question will come from Rod Hall with JPMC.Rod HallYes, hi, guys, thanks for the question. I just wanted to follow up on the gross margin a little bit. May be Brad and Tom both, Brad may be could you comment on what the -- do you have any idea what the underlying gross margin would have been without these push outs. So are we talking about sort of the high-end of the prior guidance range around 45% and the push outs added 2.8% to the gross margins or just trying to understand how much the push outs affected the gross margins and what kind of the underlying rate of gross margins would be. I know it's kind of tough to, a tough number may be to get to, but just to try to figure out even with the 46% you're still talking about a gross margin trajectory that's up on average over the last few quarters and I can't imagine it's just because of push out, other good things are going on so.Brad FellerYes, you're absolutely right, Rod. It's a piece of the puzzle right. As you know our footprint deployments traditionally come with a much lower margin profile. So it's a piece to the equation and not the sole driver. So we -- we likely would have been above the range either way.Rod HallOkay, thanks, Brad. And then on the margins the other thing I was wondering after you guys announced Transmode, I didn't ask you at the announcement call was, how much -- what are the margin drivers is vertical integration and just loading your plant. How much, it sounds like part of Transmode will allow for more about, and part may be not. Can you just comment on the degree to which this allows you to continue that vertical integration impact on gross margins and how that might play out as you integrate Transmode?Dave WelchYes, this is Dave Welch. The -- we plan on utilizing our vertical infrastructure to the degree that's appropriate within their product portfolio and fix are well suited for high capacity applications, are well suited for high density applications, they're not well suited for very low speed applications. And so we will continue to use that vertical infrastructure there. And we think that will drive our overall economic benefits.Rod HallOkay. And just last question, could I just -- just wanted to ask Tom, is, he thinks that Alcatel Lucent hiccups now, I mean the integration may take their eye of the ball a little bit. So you think that gives you an opportunity in Europe, have you seen any evidence of that yet?Tom FallonWell I think it's too soon to see evidence of it. I'm personally delighted that this is occurring. The industry or the history of the industry of large companies getting together and efficiently taking care of customers and doing things that are good about creating business in a short-term, I'm not sure there is one. And I'm a big advocate that well they're going to worry about who has got the biggest office and gets a car on the company. I’m going to work really hard to go take care of their former customers. I can tell you they've already shutdown one optical group because it wasn't strategic to them, they picked up a new optical group, I'm not sure this will be strategic to them and I think it's a great opportunity for us.Rod HallGreat. Thanks a lot guys.OperatorDmitry Netis, WB Blair. Your line is open.Dmitry NetisI have a couple of quick ones. On the system clarification to 2%, 10% customers one was I heard with the tier-1 carrier who was the other one?Brad FellerIt was Internet content provider.Dmitry NetisICP, okay great. And then how close to that 10% threshold were they are they close to the 10% or a bit above. Can you give some color?Brad FellerThe North American tier-1 you saw what they were for last year. They probably weren't that big of a percentage this quarter and then the Internet Content Provider was greater than 10% obviously but not as big as the tier-1.Dmitry NetisHow much do you expect from these customers in Q2. Do you think they're still -- I guess what stages of their deployment cycle are we -- is it continuous are we kind of in the late stage, middle stage, do you expect those guys to come back in Q2?Brad FellerYes, so Dmitry, we're going to shy away from laying out any specific customer. As you know we have a very broad customer base. We've had I think seven different customers have been greater than 10% in a given quarter; they can all drive big volumes. The strength is broad, it's not a, any given customer that is driving the growth it's across all the different verticals and multiple guys in each of the verticals.Dmitry NetisOkay, good, and then I know you've talked about Level Three but they're material customer views that could be on a 100 GigE side. You've announced some wins there. Are their network as we speak, we still kind of waiting for that to happen where are we on that front?Brad FellerYes, Dmitry, you broke up a little bit, but I think your question was on Level Three.Dmitry NetisYes.Brad FellerLevel Three is a great customer of ours; they are aggressively building with us in the U.S., in Latin America, and pretty much around the globe.Dmitry NetisOkay, Brad, and one last one, I appreciate that candid answer. I just -- the Facebook announcement was I guess well received by the investment community. Would you mind may be describing a little bit what exactly you do for them?Tom FallonRoughly, we supply our networks for them and they operate with our gear that was a particular data center connectivity that they needed from northern in the Nordics down to one of a more centralized data center applications in -- within Europe. We provide the bandwidth that leads the building and it reverses the long haul network and comes back into one of our other buildings.Dmitry NetisOkay. So it's some -- it's data finally that DTN-X products and I guess there is a line of site with CX there as well that --Brad FellerWe're not going to conflict -- they were gracious enough to allow us to do this press release which as you know they are very reluctant to do that and our rules with them are we won't talk around any of our business other than the ones they announced us lot us to announce.Dmitry NetisOkay excellent. Thank you for that. I appreciate it.Brad FellerThanks.OperatorTed Moreau of Barrington Research. Your line is open.Ted MoreauI was wondering, just referencing the opportunity with an Internet Content Provider with the DTN-X and we've also been talking about the Cloud Xpress opportunity but could you just kind of walk through how you view the growth opportunities for both the DTN-X and the Cloud Xpress and Internet Content Providers like kind of what you're seeing as the trajectories of both those product lines within that customer base for this year?Tom FallonWell I think both of them have huge opportunities, both Internet Content Providers whether they are carrying bandwidth across their backbone or going into the metros, or Interconnecting Data Center bandwidth is exploding for them. I think the fundamental difference in all that they comment is that for the backbone of their network is if they have had one, they are growing it, they are continuing to grow them; there are some Internet Content Providers that are deciding to put in backbones. But I would call it more of a decision has been made a while ago and now they're deploying and are growing with capacity.The data center interconnect market where the Cloud is going to go, it is probably the more explosive opportunity over time. It's a relatively young market today, few hindered million dollars and it's forecasted to grow to a few billion dollars over the next several years. But you are not going to see probably linear growth in that. When you create new markets with new applications you see kind of a, add some top where it starts accelerating and then you will hit some kind of knee and inflexion that it really starts exploding. When that will happen we’re not sure, but we do believe that there is going to be a lot of opportunity in Data Center Interconnect both at the larger ICP’s but also others. Dave?Dave WelchYes. You need to make sure to clarify the applications of the CX and the DTN-X platforms are different. The DTN-X is a long haul platform with integrated bandwidth management capabilities on it. And so if I'm operating on a mesh network configuration, the DTN-X is a more appropriate box.The CX is a point-to-point configuration and its generally metro reach or less types applications. It's not configured for a long haul application and has no integrated switching capabilities for it.So if I'm a Cloud provider and I’ve got my network or however I’m my network the regions of my networks that require bandwidth management and/or -- and meshed network configurations and the regions where I just need to go high capacity point-to-point and ICP's or Cloud providers will require both of those within their network architectures as we go forward.Ted MoreauOkay, great. Thanks and so I just want to make sure I'm clear. So the DTN-X sounds like it's a big opportunity this year and then not taking anything away from Could Xpress. But then Cloud Xpress kind of layers on in out years that's how we should be thinking about it.Dave WelchThe DTN-X is a full featured full network product capability. The Cloud Xpress is a point product for point-to-point connectivity in the metro region. In the DTN-X it was predominately a high capacity long haul box, but it's a Could Xpress is a high rack and stack scalable metro box two very different applications for their networks.Tom FallonYes, and Ted, just to clarify. So we do expect Cloud Xpress to ramp with those guys over the course of this year so it's not a 16, 17 opportunity. We do expect them to ramp this year.Dave WelchDefinitely.Ted MoreauOkay. And then you kind of touched on this a little bit with a lumpiness of deployments and what not, are -- do you view that the deployment scenarios with Internet Content Providers and may be could you compare like how that the deployments are from a lumpiness perspective similar or may be different from what you've historically, seen in the traditional telecom business?Dave WelchIf I'm deploying a large nationwide network, that requires a subset amount of optical infrastructure amplifiers, optical mugs etcetera; it takes time to deploy that, right. If I want to simultaneously add connectivity between dozen data centers across North America the deployment of the common infrastructures may take four, five months. That in and of itself or six or eight months it can take a while. That in and of itself drives you into a lumpy aspects of buy commons put fills in after you've done their plant. If what I’m doing our networks it go between data centers in the metro infrastructure I don’t have a lot of infrastructure to build out in which case that can be a smoother transition and frankly is driven more its less of a planning exercise and its more of reaction to how much Cloud business goes into a data center and how much bandwidth they need to provide.Tom FallonIt’s also things what you deploy as Dave was talking about large scale networks and the amount of work that has to be done. But invariably there is long poles and the pit like making sure fibres available and power into the appropriate buildings that tend to cause things outside of our control that cause some of these projects to slip.Dave WelchYes. And you have raised it, you raised an important point as the cloud network scales and the data center and the Data Center Interconnect scales it's not just going to realize itself in Cloud Xpress products. It will realize ourselves in all of our across the broad products because there is a certain amount of bandwidth that needs to go into the long haul where we’ll satisfy that with DTN-X solutions and there is a certain amount of bandwidth that will be local in nature which will be more of a Cloud Xpress solution.Ted MoreauOkay, great, congrats, and keep up the good work. Thanks guys.Tom FallonThank you.OperatorThank you. [Operator Instructions].Tom FallonOperator, it looks like we are clear on the questions. So everyone thanks for joining us this afternoon with your questions and we look forward to updating you on our continued progress. Have a good day.OperatorThank you. This will conclude today’s call. You may go ahead and disconnect.")
# 2015 q2
infn.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Mr. George"
            " Notter of Jefferies.George NotterI guess I wanted to ask about Cloud Xpress. If I remember correctly, you said last quarter you had seven customers that you had taken revenue from and this quarter, I guess, 12. I think the way you phrased it this quarter, it was 12 that are invoiced. Are we comparing apples and oranges here? Is this rev rac or is this invoicing or what are we talking about?And I also wanted to ask about the customer adds on Cloud Xpress. Can you just talk about what kind of customers you brought into the fold here? Are these Internet content providers, are they Equinix-type players, or walk us through the nature of those new customers.And then also, I think last quarter, you said you had three of the four top ICPs and I was wondering if you could update that? Have you been able to penetrate some of the other ICPs, that fourth one, five, six, seven, just give us an update of where you are with customers there.Thomas FallonGeorge, I’ll try to address all of that. The seven to 12 is in apples to apples. It is the invoice customer count for Cloud Xpress. The customers we added during the quarter is a mixture of different folks, right. There’s cloud service providers, there’s folks with the channel, we obviously announced Equinix yesterday. So it a broad mix of customers. The big ICPs continue to drive the biggest volumes in that space, but we continue to get more and more interest from a broad base of customers.George NotterAnd then you said 90% of the business is long-haul this quarter, can I infer from that that 10% of the business was Cloud Xpress?Thomas FallonNo. We do sell into some metros, it is with either the DTN or DTN-X. So we said 90%-plus was long-haul. So the other piece is the combination of other solutions.George NotterAnd then do you know that mixture from the March quarter, the 90% long-haul versus other?Thomas FallonI don’t think – our mixture hasn’t changed systemically in any fashion. The Cloud Xpress is growing. We’ve always had various levels of subsea, long-haul, metro, datacenter, interconnect activities and as we’ve pointed out before, a lot of our datacenter connections had been via DTN-X as a platform as well. So I’d say the mixture between markets remains strong and healthy.David WelchProbably the best metric is noting the top five customers are across five different market sectors.George NotterAnd then the slower revenue recognition on Cloud Xpress this year, you said it was just more about adoption cycles or eval cycles. Any more flavor you can give us there? Do you still feel the same in terms of your overall confidence in the revenue outlook for that business? Is this just a timing issue or walk us through the bigger picture?Thomas FallonI think George, I’m surprised, I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. We came out with this, I assumed people would buy it somewhat like an appliance and they are not. It’s much – to my greater surprise being certified much more classically like a telecom service provider. And the contract cycles are long, the qualification cycles are long, and it’s a surprise to me.The volumes of the units are going up nicely every quarter. So I’m happy with the progress that we’re making from an adoption perspective. I’m happy with the fact that we are growing the number of customers and I feel very good about the pipeline of, what I would consider, probable customers across Q3 and Q4. I think that we probably underestimated the pent up demand for 100 gig.I mean, we’re getting it out as fast as possible, but some of the customers have said, I’m just not going to deploy this now when I can get 100 gig in Q3, so I’m going to wait for the 100 gig. So I’m very optimistic that we’re going to sell a lot of that. I’m also extremely optimistic now, I said that we had of the 12, four have already come back from repeat purchase with new opportunities.So they’re deploying them, they’re happy with them and they’re seeing more and more opportunities for this and I’ve called it an architectural piece into their new network and I believe that’s being played out. If nobody comes back and buys it, it’s not an architectural piece. And I think that we’re being – our customers are liking what they are seeing. Dave?David WelchI just want to add one point on the – the customer cycle is, they will pick a particular location or a particular application, buy a small number of units and they’ll operationalize those units within their network. If they liked what they saw, they come back and they buy. And that’s what we’re seeing in the cycle. So we’re engaging with – and are getting early buying from the large customers that we want, but they need to first go through the operationalization out at small level and now we’re starting to see them come back and looking at things in a bigger level.So I’d say the optimism for market penetration is as strong as ever. If there is any delay, I’m not sure there’s a delay, but if there is any misexpectations on timing, it has to do with that two-step process of operationalizing a small number and then moving on to larger quantities.OperatorOur next question will come from Mr. Sanjiv Wadhwani of Stifel.Sanjiv WadhwaniTom, just to follow-up on the Cloud Xpress, you mentioned about the 100 gig. You are surprised with the pent-up demand there. Walk us through what type of customers are looking at 100 gig because I think it varies between ICPs and service providers and traditional enterprises. So just walk us through what type of customers are looking at 100 gig solutions on the Cloud Xpress.And then, you mentioned competition. There have been a couple of announcements in the last quarter or so and you walked us through some differentiation. But on a more granular level, is it power, is it the bandwidth, is it the size that helps skew the customer buying decision towards you versus the competition?Thomas FallonThe biggest skew right now that causes the customer to buy from us versus the competition is that ours is the only product shipping and there is a ton of great slideware out there that talks about all kinds of features and I look forward to our competition starting to ship something and we’ll go and do the analytics. We have a very good feeling about where we stack up, but I think that the biggest differentiator today, we’ve been shipping, we’ve been shipping for three quarters and nobody else is shipping.The advantages that we’re going to have are going to continue to be around our technology. The PIC, nobody else has a PIC. And these kind of applications uniquely favor PIC type of technology, where you integrate and make things smaller, everything gets better simultaneously. Space, power, quality and cost, all of it gets better simultaneously and there is no recipe other than integration that provides that. In regard to 100 gig, it’s mostly people that have giant bandwidth, right. It’s mostly the cloud guys, the datacenter guys. That’s who is driving the biggest earliest demand for 100 gig.Sanjiv WadhwaniBrad, just a quick follow-up on the numbers, I think the range that was out there was 30 to 60. I think Tom mentioned in the prepared remarks that high end might be a little bit on the top side. Are we looking at somewhere in the midpoint are we looking somewhere closer to the low end when it’s all said and done for the year?Brad FellerSanjiv, it’s hard to say at this point, right. Given the slower ramp in the first half, getting to the high end is going to be more difficult. We still got two quarters to go, right. And as Tom mentioned, we see more and more customers coming and asking for demos, asking for product, actually starting to order. Just practicality though to get to the high end of the range will be tough. Where we end up, I’m not going to speculate on.Thomas FallonWe’re just trying to be as transparent as possible, Sanjiv.OperatorOur next question will come from Mr. Michael Genovese of MKM Partners.Michael GenoveseMy first question is investors who some of them have recently become concerned about the near-term outlook for spending in the ICP market, but your results, your guidance doesn’t really show any need for concern. But what is your take on that? Do see any change in spending trends in the ICP market near-term?Thomas FallonIt’s interesting when people talk about CapEx cuts at either a tier 1 or an ICP and it creates a lot of churn and turmoil and fear. And my fundamental outlook is that there is nothing but fundamental demand continuing to drive from the ICPs. And I don’t see that anything on the horizon changes. CapEx, they spend CapEx in a lot of lot of ways. But at the end of the day, what they have to be able to do is get data from one datacenter to other datacenters and they have to get data, or information or video from datacenters to consumers.And as long as that demand keeps growing, I don’t see any way that they cannot continue to invest, particularly with the advent of 100 gig technology moving in which provides a lower cost infrastructure from them from a CapEx perspective, on a dollar per bit basis, on a power basis, on a space basis. There is too many either fundamental demand drivers and then also fundamental cost drivers that say 100 gig is going to help them solve a lot of their problems. So I just don’t see it. Now, maybe their CapEx elsewhere is going to be cut, but in fundamental transport, I don’t see it.Michael GenoveseAnd then moving on, when I look at the guidance for the next quarter, 4% sequential revenue growth about $8 million sequential incremental revenues, how should we think about that $8 million split between DTN-X and Cloud Xpress?Brad FellerSo Mike, I’m not going to break that down into too much detail, but obviously we expect DTN-X to continue to do well. We expect CX to, Cloud Xpress to continue to ramp, right, but we’re not going to get into exact granularity of it. The reality to it is the underlying business is very strong, we see very strong demand for CX.Michael GenoveseI will try to sneak one more in and I’ll take the answer off the air. Could you just – Transmode confidence that you’re going to get the 90%, can you quantify the confidence or is there any other kind of measure of that confidence you can give us?Thomas FallonMike, there is no magic to it, right. We have to get to 90%. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, 54% of their holders signed up before the offering period even started. So that gets a good pace along the way. We’ve obviously talked to other holders that are favorable to it. And we are consistently going and talking to more and more investors to go get above that 90%. I can’t really handicap it at this point, we’ll know better on the 7th in terms of where we are ending up. But we are very committed to making this happen; we do think it’s a strategic piece to our go forward plans.OperatorOur next question will come from Mr. Doug Clark of Goldman Sachs.Doug ClarkI want to focus a little bit on gross margins which continue to be really strong. I think the comments for this quarter were a little bit more heavily skewed towards the favorable mix shift, especially when you consider no new DTN-X customers. Is that true and how much was capacity fill a contributor to margins this quarter?Brad FellerDoug, it continues to be a combination of things. So we continue to get good leverage out of the fab, obviously we’re ramping new products which helps as well. But we are seeing people starting to order more and more capacity adds as well. So it is a combination of different things that continues to drive the margin and will continue to drive the margin going forward.Doug ClarkAnd maybe as a follow-up to that, instant bandwidth was also cited and certainly, if you look at deferred revenues, they continue to grow a little bit each quarter. Is that primarily what is driving that deferred revenue growth and is that becoming a more meaningful contributor to gross margins?Brad FellerSo one clarification, Doug, so the instant bandwidth licenses don’t sit in deferred revenue, they are nowhere on the balance sheet. So it’s really we’ve deployed a lot of instant bandwidth modules and there’s still a lot of ports to still be filled with licenses in the future. So we continue to see both customers adding new licenses, but also customers buying more and more modules. So we are able to deliver those first modules, still deliver strong margin profile and build up an annuity as they license these 100 gig licenses going forward, it’s a nice margin uplift in the future as well.Doug ClarkAnd then if I can sneak one more in as well on the gross margin front from the CX, how are those margins, can you remind us, relative to corporate average?Brad FellerI’d say it’s similar to what we’ve said since the launch, which is some of the initial bigger customers will have lower than corporate average gross margin. As we get more and more customers, I feel good about the margin profile of it. We are seeing customers adopt instant bandwidth for CX as well. So the initial margin on that will be a little bit muted, but over the long term will be higher than corporate average gross margin. So I still feel good about the margin profile of CX being at or above corporate average gross margin over time.OperatorOur next question will come from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank.Vijay BhagavathA two-part question if I may. The first part is, give us an understanding of the waterfall for the 100 gig Cloud Xpress. And where I’m coming from is, from the fourth quarter of this year, we do anticipate new merchants silica and 100 gig leaf and spine datacenter switches. Do you see that as a tailwind for the 100 gig Cloud Xpress product?Thomas FallonI think that the 100 gig, we see large datacenters today are deploying with 100 gig in both the routers and switches inside their datacenter where they want to hand off to transport. That’s moving from 10 to 40 to 100 and a lot of lot of people are moving to that 100 now as router and switch ports have become much more cost competitive around 100 gig.We could sell 100 gig right now if we had it available, we’re shipping it right now, instead we will be doing it this quarter. And there is pretty significant pent-up demand, but it’s still not the mass part of the market, it’s where people are making the investments now and have been making them recently that they want to move all of their spent, these are the large guys, to 100 gig as soon as possible.And I think that the new 100 gig for routers ports, switch ports being cost effective and us then delivering 100 gig on transport is going to create a nice combination to accelerate the 100 gig growth a lot. And I don’t think we have to wait for the inside of the datacenter to change at all. This is all the hand off of the intra to outside.David WelchThere is a secondary effect that’s going on intradatacenter where the transition of net cards at 25 gig which is going to continue, which is 2.5X increase over the current cards. The aggregation of that as it exits the datacenters where that has transitioned rapidly to 100 gig interfaces as opposed to 10 gig, especially at the volume applications.Vijay BhagavathAnd then the second part is that on the 100 gig metro opportunity, we are a little fuzzy honestly on that. Give us an understanding. You’re still working on the Transmode deal. You have a metro version of your DTN-X product looking to ship any time now. So would it be the second half of next year, Tom, and realistically, we could start seeing 100 gig metro dollars flowing into the top line? How should we view and model the 100 gig metro opportunity?Thomas FallonWe are definitely bringing our metro product to market this year, this calendar year. We are showing at the customers now and I would anticipate you could start having some reasonable amount of ramp starting in Q1 of next year. The good news is, like I said on the call, we’re going to sell this mostly at first to our current customers. It’s going to have the same fundamental ease of use, look and feel, network management, experiences the DTN-X. So I think that there is not going to have to be a long ramp up.Now clearly, we’re not going to sell out of the shoot a lot, but I think that you can start seeing revenue that’s nontrivial in the first half of the year, ramping up in the second half of the year. And if Transmode closes to our desire in the August, September timeframe, we will clearly get 100 gig volumes from that this year.OperatorOur next question will come from Dmitry Netis from William Blair.Dmitry NetisI gave a question for each one of you and pardon my poking around the customer base once again. But as you called out, I think Brad this is for you I think, the cable, the tier one and the wholesale, are these ordered from the largest contributor to the lowest contributor?Brad FellerNo. Those are the three top guys. We don’t break out who is exactly who.Dmitry NetisAnd was the tier one the US tier one, the same one we saw kind of recurring over the past year?Brad FellerYes.Dmitry NetisDo you expect these cable and tier one guys to come back in Q3?Brad FellerWhen we talk about cable, Dmitry, if you remember, cable tends to be strong in the first half of the year. They don’t order as much in the second half of the year. So I don’t expect cable to be as strong in Q3. The tier one customer has been a tier one and the enterprise and bandwidth wholesalers, have been great customers throughout and continue to spend aggressively with us.Dmitry NetisAnd then Tom, just back to this cable discussion, as we see this cable market consolidating, we have the Comcast, Time Warner in the past and we clearly heard your message there. I was wondering if you could update us on what your thoughts might be on this Time Warner cable charter Bright House acquisition strategy there and how are you positioned for the good or for worse as this thing occurs?Thomas FallonI think if it occurs, I personally view that we’re going to be in a good spot with this. One of those companies has a backbone, one doesn’t. The backbone is ours today. And I can’t imagine building a new backbone just because you buy somebody. Why would you want to build out your own new backbone when you can leverage the one that you already would have. So I think that this is a – for the same reason, it makes sense for those guys to get together, I think will have an opportunity to really leverage some of the infrastructure in place and a lot of that infrastructure is ours. So I think it would be not a bad thing.Now, in any type of acquisition, there is always the period where things can slow down until the deal is done. As Brad had mentioned, however, that cable historically is not that strong in the second half of the year. So we’re in that period now. And assuming that it doesn’t take an unreasonable period of time to get done, we should be in time for an early next year buying cycle. So I’m optimistic on what it means to Infinera. I have no idea whether it’ll happen in the industry or not, I don’t track it within any trade competitiveness, et cetera. My suspicion is it will go through.Dmitry NetisAnd then last one for Dave, as we track this highly hyper growth DCI market, I suppose, and all the competitors that are jumping in the fray there. Ciena came out with a wave server. They’re also announcing their acquisition or have announced their acquisition of Cyan which provides this multi-vendor orchestrator. Just kind of an interesting idea because they can come in to datacenter and start managing multiple environments that aren’t Ciena’s based environments.And so my question is, how are you positioned in this multi-vendor orchestration [indiscernible] orchestration environment? I know you’ve been working on the ESDM controller. I don’t know if it’s multi-vendor are not. Can you give us a sense of where you are and how competitive you might be to this Blue Planet piece of software that Ciena is buying?David WelchI’m not sure I’m going to be able to shed as much light as you would like on that question. The market at this point in time is such that they can see value of being able to operationally establish services through a common control plane. That’s what’s motivating the development of SDN. I think it’s clear that SDN, as it develops, is not going to be a controller, but it’s going to be a series of controllers, and controllers of controllers and depending on the application that people want on that.And that’s what’s critically important for our business where we view our business as in the equipment necessary to establish services in the WAN as that we can integrate into our customers’ control system, which is how we integrate today and to whatever control system that customer wants to buy, maybe Blue Planet, maybe any of the number of other controllers in our market place.And then finally to make sure that we can put together the right management structure that allows for our industry leading ease of use of establishing services. So there’s going to be a number of places which we integrate into and that transition from the current control plane structure that exists with customers to an SDN ramp is a multi-year event and it’s going to depend very much on the different customer bases.Dmitry NetisDo you foresee opening your APIs to this Blue Planet software?David WelchWe integrate into our customers’ infrastructure today. They sit there and operate our network with adjacent router networks, with adjacent switch networks and manage services across that. And today, our customer has their own management software that does that. In the telco stream it’s Oz Mine. In the Internet content provider stream, it’s a very simplified network controller that they built to do that.And for us to play across the multi-markets, we will integrate in with a controller that our customers ask us to integrate in with. Our Pacnet demonstration was integrating in with the first deployment of a true SDN, service was with a third-party controller that Pacnet elected to choose. And so that point of integration is going to be varied.What’s clear from the customer bases, there isn’t going to be an equipment provider isn’t going to dictate a controller across all of the networks. It’s just not going to happen. The customer base won’t allow it that to happen. And what we do best, as we put bandwidth onto network better faster than anyone out there and we allow the ease of use and control of that and the customer experience to be better than anyone else out there. And we will work with our customers to make sure that they can turn on services faster than anyone else and that they can monetize their investments faster than anyone else.OperatorOur next question will come from Mr. Alex Henderson of Needham.Alex HendersonI’ve got a simple question for you, but it entails unfortunately more than one quarter of thought. So if I look back over the last 18 to 24 months, we’ve seen a beautiful acceleration and superb execution as you’ve gone up into the 30s in growth in the fourth quarter last year and first quarter this year. You are on track to do 25% plus type growth this year.Should we be thinking about the out period as having enough acceleration in demand associated with the DCI market, cloud to cloud market, combining with continued strength in long-haul and subsea that we should think about you as able to sustain higher than that sort of 10% plus kind of market growth that people have talked to? How should we think about the longer-term periods as we start to run up against these extraordinarily difficult comps we will have in 4Q and 1Q coming forward?Thomas FallonSo this is how I’m going to look at it and I’ve had explained to people. The long-haul market where we’ve primarily grown is growing at about 8% a year. We’ve obviously been very successful at growing with that market, but also taking significant market share from other people. And to your point, that becomes challenging as you become a significant participant of market share.The very unique position we find ourselves in is that with our same fundamental technology and a lot of the same customers, we have the opportunity to go from the long haul market to the long haul plus metro market, that Metro market is a $5 billion or $6 billion market, also growing 8% to 10%.And then you take the DCI market which is fairly small today, a few hundred million dollars, growing to few billion dollars, I find it remarkably unique position as a company that doesn’t have the change its DNA, doesn’t have to change its way of going to market, doesn’t have to change its technology and can go from $4 billion market today to the $15 billion-plus market over the next few years. That is a shocking opportunity.Now, we won’t be able to serve all pieces of that market, but the point that you are making about can we outgrow the 10% range in the long haul market, yes, I think we could in the long term. But over the next several years, we are not going to be in the long haul market alone, its long haul, metro, cloud, subsea, and it’s a $15 billion market opportunity.If you look at our market share in long haul, I can tell you I’m not going to over a period of time accept anything less than that kind of market share in the larger market that we are going to go pursue. That’s going to take some time and some work. And I don’t want everybody to believe that this is going to be a linear up until the right kind of progression. But our strategy over the next several years is to recreate our success in the long haul by leveraging our core technologies and optimizing them and going into adjacent spaces that will allow us to fundamentally triple the market we’re serving. It excites me up.Alex HendersonSecond question, I think I also know the answer to this. I keep getting asked the question about people coming out with “white label pizza box” going after this DCI market, cloud to cloud market, based on the idea that there is an increasing availability of off the shelf transceivers capable of doing 100 gig that are sold as straight out modules. Can you address that, because I keep getting asked the question? I think I know the answer, but I just want to hear your response.Thomas FallonThere has always been off the shelf technology, always and people have always been able to take things and piece them together for niche solutions. But in the history, people who invest in technology have captured the largest market share. And I don’t think that’s going to change.Just because you can buy a 100 gig off the shelf from somebody, that doesn’t mean it’s differentiated, it doesn’t mean it means optimized for space, power, capacity, reach, any of those things. And I think you’re going to see that just like in the long haul, coherent matters, PICs matter, you’re going to see that even more so in the metro.And I think this is an area where I do agree with Ciena who had the same comment, I think, this week when they were asked about this. They just don’t fundamentally believe that off the shelf technology is going to solve the bulk of the problem. Well, some people go out and maybe try to save a few pennies by building something themselves, they might.But I think at the end of the day, the cost curve of the technology that we’re providing, the dollar per bit we provide on the transport level, the ability to scale that to magnificent size scale, I really don’t think most of our customers today enhance their bottom line by trying to save a few pennies off a transponder from off the shelf and making the stuff themselves. I just don’t see it. It’s not that big of a scale.Alex HendersonSo not even in the big sky market where they’ve historically had a tendency to try that?Thomas FallonI think on servers, how many billions of dollars of servers and switches, those markets, they spend enough money that it might actually make a difference. They are not buying, in my mind, enough transport, I hope they do some day, to fundamentally move the needle in their bottom line by building it themselves and I don’t know why they would ever go about trying to do that – in our market, in the market, the optical industry bears about 40% industry margin. In the switching business, they are trying to cannibalize the 70% margin business of those guys. It’s not the same thing.And as you have been reading, a lot of these ICP guys are all talking about trying to make sure they are only investing where they can have significant, it’s more mature right, only investing where they can have significant payoff. Building white box optical switches or transport boxes, to me, it’s not in the first thousand items of waste for them to be more efficient. It’s just not.Alex HendersonPerfect. That’s what I would have expected you to say. One last question.Thomas FallonDave wants to just add one thing. One second.David WelchThe industry is forgetting a key thing. When the integrated circuit expanded, you could buy off the shelf discrete components. And it’s off the shelf. But when you have a high capacity demand and I got to buy a bunch of discrete components at a low bandwidth requirement, you are not doing it in the lowest cost structure rate possible.Intel integrated circuits, all that came out is a proven thesis, you put this stuff on an integrated platform, you go for something that is in our case more bandwidth, in their case more computing power, you can make things in a more sophisticated less-expensive than you can in a discrete fashion. And that’s what drives this. That’s where we are the only provider, the only capability of high capacity photonic integrated circuits. If your application requires bandwidth, we will be able to supply that in a much more reliable productive higher density capability.Alex HendersonOne last question, if I could. The metro core product, you’ve been surprised at the rate of adoption timeline, the amount of testing for the Cloud Xpress taking longer than you’d expected. It seems to me that the adoption rate for a metro core product which is going into a much more complex multi-mesh environment, would be much harder to get into the install base without significant testing and a significant amount of potential revenue recognition criteria on those contracts. Isn’t it reasonable to think that that would take considerably longer for that product to reach revenues at ramp than the shove it in type approach of some of the Web 2.0 players?Thomas FallonWe were surprised at how long it’s taken for the Web 2.0. The metro aggregation product we’re coming out is going to a customer base that we know well, who has a large installed base of our product. And I think we have a pretty good understanding of how they will get certified there. It won’t happen overnight, I agree with you, but this one is not going to be a surprise to us.OperatorThe next question will come from Rod Hall of JPMorgan.Rod HallSo a couple of things. First of all, I wanted to see if you have any idea how far through the conversion of datacenter interconnect we are? The movement from leased line to owned facilities. And then secondly, you guys talked about new risked opportunities with the partnership there. Can you just expand a little bit on what’s going on there? Do you think you’re gaining new customer access? Customers you did not have access to before and it’s mostly footprint expansion in customers you’re already in? Can you talk a little bit more about what opportunities that affords you?Thomas FallonSure. I will answer the second one; I’ll let Dave handle the question on datacenter technology conversion. Arista and us approach this with the same kind of model. We want our customers to be able to provide them with best in class transport and best in class switching. They want the same thing versus the model of a large competitor providing an end to end where they are prisoner of having maybe inferior choices of one or both. And we are going to do this in a fashion that such that customer wins around best in class technology and we are going to go and integrate with Arista around ease of use and SDN.And we are training our sales forces mutually and the opportunity for Infinera, I think, for both companies is good, but for Infinera candidly is probably better. We have a couple of hundred customers at most that we can help introduce them to; they have several thousand customers that they can help us being introduced to.That doesn’t mean that all of them would necessarily want transport or need transport, but we see a very large potential opportunity to expand into markets that we aren’t going to have a direct sales force, financial markets would be a good example, large enterprise is another example and we’ve had some joint sales calls now.And so far early days, I’m optimistic that this could be meaningfully positive to both companies. I don’t have an update to say it’s going to move the needle, but at least early interactions are both companies are excited about the potential of providing a world-class end to end solution to these customers.David WelchI think your second question was where are we in the datacenter interconnect cycle? I would have to say extremely early in that process. The world is rapidly converting to more and more content moving into the cloud. These transitions are very early.Rod HallHave you guys quantified that at all?David WelchWhere in the cycle?Rod HallYes. Do you guys have a number of datacenters and the proportion of them that have connectivity in your estimation or is it just an unknown quantity out there?David WelchThe datacenter interconnect projections have a growth rate of somewhere in the excess of 60% type of growth, which is well above that of long haul. I think we’ve just recently transitioned where machine to machine traffic has equated the person to person traffic. Since machine to machine traffic is technically is a multiplier of hundred to a thousand times the amount of bandwidth required to handle that, I fully expect that in the coming years the machine to machine traffic is going to dwarf the person to person traffic as it goes along. And that is datacenter interconnect traffic.Thomas FallonThere is something like 500,000 datacenters today in the world, but it comes more interesting is when you look at who has five or more of them, right, from our perspective. And we’re actually in the process of vetting that right now, so maybe I’ll give you an update when I see you next.Operator[Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Subu Subrahmanyan of The Juda Group.Subu SubrahmanyanI wanted to take a shot at the metro question once again. Tom, if you think about the 8% growth in the long-haul market continues into next year and some of the factors between CX Transmode products and your metro aggregation product starting to impact that, do you think for 2016, Infinera will be able to see a full benefit of having a full-year benefit of having the metro products? Does it start to get more meaningful around mid-year? I’m just trying to understand when you feel like the metro opportunity can fully realize with your product portfolio.Thomas FallonIt’s a hard question, Subu, because a lot of it depends quite frankly on Transmode and both the timing of that and the success of that. And if this closes in August/September, I would certainly anticipate getting the full benefit of next year and hopefully accelerating it because we’re going to apply a sales force to this product offering that’s a lot bigger than the Transmode sales team. So I think there should be acceleration. But until that’s done, it’s very hard to say, and it depends on when it closes.I think for our own metro aggregation product, I think we will start seeing sales, certainly and revenue in Q1, but I would say the meaningful revenue would be in the second half of the year candidly, but we will get revenue in the first half. In cloud, I have actually pretty significant expectations for cloud for next year. So I think we’re going to have a whole portfolio out there, we’re going to have gone through the digestive period and learning about all of the certification issues and contracting issues and operationalizing issues and we’re going to have set a very, very nice table to enjoy Cloud Xpress volumes next year.David WelchI think an interesting way to looking that, in the long haul space, we’ve spent a number of years and I think our best metric is 40%, we maintained our 40% North American market share for a number of years. We’re entering into metro market space, we have single digit, small single digit market share in that. We think our technologies play equally well across high capacity metros at doing long haul, so I think it’d be a number of years as we grow into a major supplier across North America and the world.OperatorOur next question will come from Ted Moreau of Barrington Research.Ted MoreauI was wondering how do you see the Cloud Xpress mix shaking out in the second half of this year between 10 gig, 40 gig and 100 gig? And I assume that the 40 gig really starts to fall off now that you have the 100 gig version available?Thomas FallonThe market is going to migrate into 10 and 100, so you are correct that overtime the transition will happen from 40 to –40 will convert to 100. And I’d say that’s probably the – will be the faster product lifecycle. The 10 gig is going to last for a long time, because datacenters come in all shapes and sizes for that and services are coming in shapes and sizes, but I think the 40 gig is probably good, 12 months, 18 months something like that, but over that course of time it will transition to 100 gig.Ted MoreauAnd then I hear you about the delay in Cloud Xpress revenue because of waiting for 100 gig. I was just wondering, do think any influence came from all the competing solutions that are out there hitting the market? I know there are more slideware, as you were saying, but do you think that’s had an influence at all?Thomas FallonI don’t think it had any influence whatsoever. I think we were the first mover, we saw the opportunity, we listened to customers, we created a differentiated approach with our differentiated technology. I think the industry is trying to scramble to catch up. I’m really enjoying quite frankly the number of people who are introducing products and I’m really enjoying the amount of time some of our competition is talking about how their product is going to be a lot better than ours.Right now, if you want it, a lot of these guys want it right now, you can get it in one place. And we are enjoying that and we are not having, to date, a problem with selling against somebody who is going to have something. It’s going to be an explosive market and when they do come out with things, I think they will have opportunities too. And that’s when there will be a more competitive challenge.Ted MoreauAnd then one final question. Given the number of guys that are coming out with these types of boxes, I mean I hear you about the technology prowess of Infinera, what prevents this market from facing tougher gross margins similar to maybe what we saw at 10 gig with so many players out there? What prevents that from becoming a little more challenging on the gross margin side?David WelchI’m going to answer it in two steps. First, you got to understand the guys that run datacenters, their lifeblood is that data that exists that building. And so they will be very cautious about who they entrust with their lifeblood. So it’s very simplistic to view the market that I can get some and I’m going to go trust my life on a white box, I entrust my life on companies and people behind the companies and people that back their products on those companies.And that’s why, quite honestly, we get recognized as the industry leader as far as customer support and we get recognized that our margins are better than our competitors’ one, because we have a great cost structure and two because our customers value that added capability to us. So I’m not worried about our ability to satisfy our customers’ needs and the presence of a discrete-based technology compared to PIC-based technology, I’m not worried about it because we meet what the customer values from us.Thomas FallonIn closing, we look forward to seeing you at Inside Infinera 2015 on October 6. Thank you for joining us this afternoon and for your questions. Have a great rest of day. Thank you.OperatorThat concludes today’s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.")
# 2015 q3
infn.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. All right."
            " Our first question comes from the line of George from Jefferies. Your line is now open.George Charles Notter - Jefferies LLCHi guys. Can you hear me?Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorYeah, George.Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerYeah.George Charles Notter - Jefferies LLCGreat. Hey, thanks very much. All right. So I guess I have a few questions here. So if memory serves, the 50% gross margin and 15% operating margin target was never an official target, I think you guys were going to hold back on that and kind of wait until the Transmode math was, I guess, sort of well-understood within Infinera. So is that a new set of targets for you guys and what timeframe are we talking about for that target?Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorYeah. So George that's always been the longer term target as we've talked about before, we'll formally update the model in terms of when that will happen probably sometime mid next year. But that's been the target all along and we still feel very good about our ability to achieve that overtime.George Charles Notter - Jefferies LLCGot it. Okay. And then I also wanted to ask about Cloud Xpress this quarter. So there was a range that was out there think you guys had talked about $30 million to $60 million for the full year, I think more recently you were talking about like lower end of that range. I guess, I was curious how much incremental revenue you got from Cloud Xpress this quarter, and how do you feel about that full year range at this point?Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerYeah. So George we're not going to break out the number specifically, but we feel very good about our ability to be inside that range, as Tom and I both noted in our prepared remarks. We had a great quarter with Cloud Xpress, revenues were up significantly. We launched the 100 GigE version of the product and we feel great about the opportunity for that product.George Charles Notter - Jefferies LLCOkay. What do you see as the barriers to driving additional top line there? Is it manufacturing capacity? Is it just customer adoption? Is it readiness for 100 Gig in your data center networks, so how do you think about gating factors on growth?Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorI don't think there's really not of gating factors, it's an absorption into an industry, as the industry puts in these new data center architectures. I think that overtime 100 Gig will probably be the dominant technology interconnecting those, but there is still a lot of 10 Gig and 40 Gig out there today and there is a little bit of people who are transitioning to 100 Gig, they're not going to go an upgrade to a 10 Gig or 40 Gig, if right around the corner, they are going to go to a 100 Gig. Now we have 100 Gig out there, and we have to go dance with them around, well, I got 40 Gig today, and I'm going to be upgrading slowly how do I go deal with that and we are working with them on that.I think I am as optimistic as I have ever been on the opportunity for both the CX, Cloud Xpress and the XT-500 to support the Internet content provider market, the data center market, and I think that by having – we've now been in the market for coming up to a year, I think that's a substitute advantage for us, as there was as I said before, fairly long certification processes, the nine months we've been working with these guys, we've grown more intimate with them. They have become more familiar with our technology and our roadmap. So I do not think that there is any impediment. I think it is a natural absorption as technologies evolved in the data center.George Charles Notter - Jefferies LLCGreat. Thank you.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorThanks George.Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerThanks George.OperatorOur next question comes from Sanjiv from Stifel. Your line is now open.Sanjiv R. Wadhwani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.Thanks. So I wanted to ask you in the prepared commentary you talked about some mix signals on demand. I was wondering if you could kind of elaborate on that a little bit? And then looking out into 2016, what is the assessment of the growth of the overall long-haul market? And then I have one follow-up question.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorSure. As you know I tried to be as transparent as I can possibly be. Clearly, we had a great Q3. Clearly we are guiding to a great Q4, so the fundamentals I see are very solid. I still believe that in the long-term all of the demand drivers for the industry, particularly for people like Infinera, who are building intelligent optical networks are very positive as positive as they have ever been. But for the first time in a while, we've seen a couple of customers push out some deliveries, not cancel any orders, but push some orders out from Q4 to Q1.We are not seeing what I would – and maybe it's just too early really opportunities for year-end money. We never count on year end money, but usually in an up-growth of environment there is usually some that does happen. We're not seeing it yet. And we're seeing Europe not being quite as stronger recovery. It's doing all right, but I had anticipated more in Europe. So clearly, the short-term, our guidance says a lot. There have been a couple of indications that a couple of customers at least are pushing things out, and I think it's just appropriate to let people know that.The other side of the coin is, lead times on optical components have not been this long for years. So there are networks to the best of my knowledge being built. Sometimes those orders get canceled if things change in the industry. But right now, lead times have extended, so I am still optimistic that the overall industry is solid, and we might be seeing nothing more than a couple of customers with year-end budget crunches affecting us. For next year, it's too early to call. We will really have a good view of next year probably until sometime in the first quarter when all of our customers get their budgets set and start having the dialogues with us. I know that there is still a lot of network that is being planned to be built.The fundamental demand when I talk to internet content providers, there is nothing in my mind that's slowing that demand down, but it's too early to call on what the budget is going to be. If you listen to the industry analyst, their forecast is that long-haul is going to slow down a little bit on a growth perspective, probably the 6% range or so. Metro is going to increase its growth perspective probably 8% to 10%. I don't know if it is right or wrong, but 8% to 10%, the industry has been growing for the last couple of years. I would assume it is going to grow that much in the next couple of years. And then our job is to take market share.Sanjiv R. Wadhwani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.That's helpful actually. Brad, just one follow-up, you guys obviously did well on the gross margin front for Q3, guided well for Q4. As you look out into next year, what are the puts and takes around gross margins that we should be thinking about as we kind of model out next year? Thanks.Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerSure. Yeah, obviously as you know Sanjiv, there's a lot of moving parts with our gross margin and as you know as well, many of them are going in the advancing direction. If I break those down and you look at the continuing ongoing benefits we've had, the vertical integration advantage we have is volumes continue to grow, the long-haul markets are starting to shift to more capacity adds versus new networks being built which obviously enhances margin, we've put out a lot of first-in modules for instant bandwidth that those licenses when they come, will come in at full 100% margin. We are now purpose building products for different markets whether it's Cloud Xpress, whether it's the XTC-2, whether it's the XT-500 or the Transmode Metro portfolio, those are making sure that we optimize cost for all applications in the network.And then if you think about the addition of the Transmode business, they've historically been greater than 50% gross margin. Under our umbrella we'll have the ability to improve their cost structure through volume synergies with the supply chain guys; we'll be able to integrate our vertical IP over time, so those are all positive things. The take side of things, as we've said, we plan to be aggressive to go take share in the Metro market, but within our corporate profitability objectives, including gross margins at 50% over time. I think the thing people forget is those things do not have to be at odds. We've done a great job of balancing those things historically and shown an ability to maintain a balance and continue to improve our gross margins. We don't plan to change anything there. Obviously, our customers continue to put price pressure on us, but having control of our cost structure, we can still give them at an attractive price and still enhance our gross margin. So we still feel great about our opportunity to grow margin over time.Sanjiv R. Wadhwani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.Got it. That's helpful. Thanks guys.Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerSure.OperatorOur next question comes from Vijay of Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is now open.Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.Yeah, hi. Yeah, hi Tom.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorHow are you?Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.Yeah hi, doing fine. So the question is a follow-up, if I may. The question is around demand commentary. You give us commentary on the Web 2.0 cloud segment, U.S. cable customers, overseas customers, ISDs so that they get kind of a good snapshot on end market demand near-term? Thanks.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorWell, I think you ask about various verticals. In Internet content space continues to be very strong both from a results perspective and also I anticipate them continuing to build a substantive amount of capacity for the foreseeable future. Cable, almost never buys much in the second half of the year, so this is kind of a typical low for the whole cable industry. We did have some cable business in Q3 which is unusual, quite frankly. So I'm not concerned about the cable space at this point, but clearly in the cable space there is ongoing acquisitions, ongoing consolidation.I think that is – I view it as an opportunity. These companies being acquired, we have a very large installed base at these companies, so the thought of being displaced to me really is I can't imagine it, so I am looking forward to these acquisitions getting completed, so that we can go on to helping them build their businesses. We probably won't know what it means until sometime next year, but I anticipate a strong first half build cycle with the cable guys.The international markets, to Brad's comment, LatAm is doing extremely well for us. It continues to grow. We continue to invest there. We continue to have more opportunities. And I believe overtime it represents a bigger portion of our company's revenue. APAC, I think we have an opportunity, both us and Transmode, quite frankly, we're not very strong in APAC, but I think the combined portfolio will help us win some business particularly with our new Metro offerings.The DTN-X was a little bit big for a lot of the APAC regions, I think with Transmode we can help foster better growth within the Metro by having a comprehensive portfolio. Europe's doing okay for us. But I think some of our competitors have particularly as they sell to enterprises in DWDM, have done very well. I keep hoping that ours is going to continue to accelerate growth. So far that hasn't really happened, but I'm, I guess, optimistic – cautiously optimistic that they are going to start investing and now that we have a broad Metro portfolio, we're probably better positioned to leverage our long-haul relationships in that market with a portfolio. And I do see some traction there. It's just not paying off yet. Russia continues obviously to be kind of on hold for us.So overall I think it's a good business environment. The wholesale – we didn't talk about wholesale and enterprise carrier, that's doing extremely well. We're obviously extremely well-positioned there, and we're doing very well across a number of customers in that specific space, both domestically and internationally.Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.Excellent. And sorry for asking that question it's....Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorNo.Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc....very long, but very helpful answer. A quick follow-on if I may. One of the bigger service providers I spoke with recently was mentioning to me that 100 Gig is an inflection point for PIC-100 and above is when PIC starts getting interesting to them. So I'd like to get kind of your side of the fence Tom on the relevance of PIC-100 Gig and plus? Thanks.David F. Welch - Co-Founder, President & DirectorYeah let me, this is Dave Welch I will chime in here. The PIC offers a density benefit to be able to put more bandwidth on the network quicker, faster and easier to operate. And so 100 Gig, a transition of the network from 10 Gig to 100 Gig per wave we're going from 500 gigabits per PIC today to a higher number in 2016. That just adds to our advantage. The higher the bandwidth goes, the more differentiated our products become.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorIt's interesting that you say Tier 1, I'd said that the PIC becomes interesting above 100 Gig for them. Clearly, the PIC's been very interesting to the industry for a long time. We became number one market share in 10 Gig wavelengths during that period of time when 10 Gig was the dominant technology, we become number one in 100 Gig outside of China, when that was the predominant technology. And as Dave said, as the densities and speeds get higher it actually becomes more important, more relevant not only to Tier 1s, but to the market in general. And I would say even more than the Tier 1s the internet content guys are going to drive the value proposition for our high-capacity PICs. They will be the first people to deploy it. So I am more convinced than ever that over time just as our competitors point out, at some point photonic integration becomes mandatory. We just got there before the rest of the industry.Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.Excellent. Thank you again.David F. Welch - Co-Founder, President & DirectorThanks Vijay.OperatorAll right. Our next question comes from Michael of MKM Partners. Sir, your line is now open.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorMichael? We can't hear you.OperatorOkay. Sir, I think we lost him.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorOkay.OperatorNext question comes from Alex of Needham. Your line is now open.Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLCI am always slipping in there behind Mike.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorNot this time. Not this time.Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLCYeah, no, no, no, that's true So there seems to be two basic themes that are playing out in terms of people having bearish positions on both, you and for that matter Ciena which is that, the idea that you are going to be an attacker, and the Metro is going to cause margin pressure and the idea that the market for this technology is extremely competitive and getting more competitive, and the pricing pressure is going to drive margins down. Those two points relate to two different issues. And I was wondering if you could address a couple of either side of that.The first one is, are you seeing an environment where there is more surety on terms of who is winning and who is establishing the dominant position in the marketplace going forward, and somewhat lessening of the viability of some of your competitors as ALU gets bought by Nokia as people like Fujitsu maybe getting pushed out of major networks and become more regional, as Tellabs and Coriant struggle under the ownership of a private company. Is the market starting to become less competitive?And then second, the idea that you are going to have to be more aggressive on price, and Metro impacting 2016 numbers, strikes me as a little odd in the sense that the vast majority of the new customers you would get in Metro would have a longer timeline to realizing sales. And I would think that most of your Metro sales in 2016 would come where you're already the incumbent and that there is a real advantage taking your 100 Gig connections from long-haul into the Metro at your existing customers. Can you address that issue please?Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorYeah, I assume two issues, I'm going to start with the consolidating industry view. And I've been I think pretty clear on that for a long time. The industry is going to continue to consolidate. I believe that with all of my heart. I think there's going to be new winners, and there's going to be a bunch of losers. I think that part of the winner's ability is having the end-to-end portfolio. It's one of the reasons we bought Transmode and are extending into new markets. I think one of them is how much R&D can you spend to own vertical IP and making sure you differentiate around that IP. This industry is becoming more expensive to lead in, and there's only going to be a handful of people I think who have the capacity to do that; we clearly are one of them. And quite frankly, we are investing in the IP before we could afford to, because we knew we had to.I think that the number of people that will go away is pretty broad. Sometimes it's going to be subscale players. If you look in the Metro space there are a number of subscale players. They might be able to survive as very niche participants. But they're going to have to restructure themselves down to niche size. I think a lot of them just go away, and that's going to yield an opportunity for us and other people who are going to be the winners. I also think there are some of the larger ones you mentioned, Fujitsu I think personally has to reposition themselves, an untrivial portion of their revenue, at some point it's going to be deprived, because they lost the Verizon opportunity and they're going to have to repurpose themselves. I think Coriant, personally I believe is challenged; I think that they're going to have a significant challenge to support the breadth of the portfolio they have on shrinking market share. So I think that all those are good signs for us and a couple of other winners, there are going to be other winners besides us, but not a lot. I think that's good signs for us to be able to pick up market share.A part of the challenge in my mind, when companies are struggling, they don't die gracefully, they don't die elegantly, they don't throw in the white flag and give up. What they typically do is lower prices to buy market share and survive. That is going to happen in certain places in this market without question. And I think that leads into your second question which is what am I going to do in the Metro? And I have commented that we're going to be aggressive in the Metro, and I think people have taken that to an illogical extreme.As Brad pointed out, the Transmode product we acquired has margins greater than 50% and our corporate margin structure that we have not committed a timeframe to is 50 points. We have the opportunity to be aggressive in the Metro. It's still less than 20% of our corporate business, without tanking our corporate business model. And I don't know why people had drawn an illogical conclusion that me saying we're going to be aggressive in the Metro, says we're going to go tank our goals about creating a 50-point margin company. There are not orthogonal to one another. And it's proven over time.Our market share and margin are correlated. If you burn market share, you will over time enhance your corporate margin. We are in this for the long-term. We are going to go aggressively into the Metro. We're not going to go by business, that is dumb business. We're going to grow market share, and we're going to create a company with 50 points of gross margin. Those are things we are going to go do. It's going to take us a while and people need to – I think investors need to think about the long-term and think less about next week. And we bought Transmode not to be a niche player in Metro, but to be a leading company end-to-end in optical transport. As optical transport becomes more strategic in the industry, as more intelligence is put into the transport layer, and as the industry consolidates, it is a excellent time for us to be doing this.David F. Welch - Co-Founder, President & DirectorYeah. And just to add to that Alex, I mean, the comment about us being aggressive in Metro, we're aggressive wherever we do business, right? We like to win and we have the business structure that we can be aggressive and still deliver a very profitable business. We do it today by balancing our book of business, right? We have different margin profiles across different customers, and we're committed to continuing to balance that and make sure that we continue to enhance the corporate margins.Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLCIf I could just follow-up two last questions and I'll cede the floor. One, just trivial before I forget that, can you give us the guidance on 2016 tax rate? But the second one back to the original question I just asked, the shift of ALU into Nokia, who has already exited the optical market once, and I believe ALU has been the price leader in the marketplace for the last 18 months plus. Do you see any signs of them altering courses, Nokia brings them under and tries to make them stop losing money and stop being irrational on pricing? Do you see that transition happening at all yet and do you think it will?Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerI'll let Tom address the second one, and then I'll address the tax one after.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorYeah, we do see them as being price leaders in the industry; I still don't understand the rationale, but we consistently see that, particularly in Europe, and they might have an advantage in Europe there with the dollar exchange rate stuff, but they've been price leaders before that. I guess, I can't speak to why that's their strategy. In regard to Nokia buying them and altering that strategy, I don't have any inside information on that, but my suspicion is they are not buying pieces of businesses, they are buying a business and they're going to let Basil run that organization the best way he sees fit. I think the bigger question in my mind is, Nokia sold a optical group to Coriant two years or three years ago, because it wasn't strategic to them. They now have another optical group. Is this one strategic to them or not? I don't know. But if I was a customer, I'd certainly be asking them that question, why wasn't it strategic, and why is it now?Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerYeah. And to address the first part of your question Alex, the reality is as we continue to make more and more money us being a actual tax payer becomes more of an issue which is a good thing for the business. Obviously, the Transmode business is a taxpayer today. Their tax rate is north of 20%. We're not ready for 2016 to model a formal tax rate, but we can update you on that overtime.Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLCIs it reasonable to think that's in the teens kind of number, I mean just generally, well we need to get in the ballpark at least?Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerYeah, we can help you model that offline.Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLCOkay. Thank you. Thank you for the great answers by the way.Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerThanks.Jeff Hustis - Head-Investor RelationsOperator, go to the next question please.OperatorOkay. Our next question comes from the line of Michael from MKM Partners. Your line is now open.Michael E. Genovese - MKM Partners LLCHey, can you hear me?Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorYes. We can Michael (45:10).Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial Officer(45:09).Michael E. Genovese - MKM Partners LLCOkay. It's fine. All right. Don't mind that. So Tom, I'm trying to reconcile the comment about the push-outs with the solid guidance. So first of all, are you saying the guidance would have been materially higher if you hadn't seen these push-outs recently? And just help me understand a little bit better again, was this more of a Metro push-outs, long-haul push-outs, like you said Europe, and telecom, what vertical specifically or types of carriers were these, push-outs being seen in?Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorAnd so I'm going to be dissatisfying to you on this. I tried to be very transparent on what we're seeing. And it wasn't big push-outs. I have no idea what the guidance would have been, because the push-outs occurred before Brad and I and Dave sat down and said what's our guidance going to be. The only reason I bring it up is because it's the first time we've seen this in a little while and it is orthogonal to what we see happening from the component business, it's orthogonal to what we see happening with a lot of our verticals, and I may be overly transparent on this, and I think people are going to overly worry about it. So I wouldn't make more of it than it is, which is a couple of customers pushed some stuff from Q4 into Q1.Michael E. Genovese - MKM Partners LLCOkay. It sounds a really good answer. And then Brad I wanted to ask you, it sounds like you don't want to give revenue breakouts anymore going forward between core and Transmode. So I'm wondering what are you going to provide? Are we going to be able to track long-haul versus Metro versus data center interconnect's performance and what about on gross margins, will you continue to give Transmode gross margins versus core gross margins for at least several more quarters?Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerYeah. So Mike, the reality is it's run as an integrated business. So we plan to run it as an integrated business going forward. It's not a separate business that we're going to be able to easily break out. We will give you color on different things, but we plan to run them as a combined business. So it's not a – I'm trying to be cagey on things, it's just a reality of – our goal is to run a combined business that has opportunities across both with traditional Transmode customers, traditional Infinera customers, and we don't want to run a separate set of books on the two sets just to give updates like that.Michael E. Genovese - MKM Partners LLCOkay. Well, I'm still thinking about how I feel about that answer, but I appreciate you giving it. So thanks a lot guys and congratulations and good luck.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorThank you.Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerThanks.Jeff Hustis - Head-Investor RelationsOperator, next question.OperatorOkay. Our next question comes from the line of Doug from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.Douglas Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co.Great. Thanks a lot. I was just curious on the Transmode impact; when you initially announced the deal you talked about it being neutral to slightly dilutive in the first half of – excuse me, in the second half of 2015. It appears that gross margins expanded relative to what they had been guiding and was probably accretive to your results. So I was just wondering what came in kind of better than expected, was it just lower expenses recognized in the third quarter?Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerYeah. So their gross margins were actually in line with what they have done historically. From an overall bottom line perspective, it was roughly neutral for the quarter. But obviously, that's only five weeks of the quarter, so.Douglas Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co.Okay. Got it. Got it. Thanks for clarifying that. And then on the Cloud Xpress, it sounds like there was a pretty nice sequential uptick in Cloud Xpress-related revenues. Is that driven primarily by the 100 Gig variant being available, or was it broad based across the board? And similarly related to that, can you just help us, I think we've asked this in the past but, size, how large your end customer exposure to ICPs are in general?Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorYeah. So Doug the 100 GigE version launch right at the end of the quarter, so that's not what's driving the upside in the revenue. It's the existing product. It's very strong within the ICP space. So those are the guys that are driving the incremental revenue. Obviously, 100 Gig, as we go forward or the 100 GigE version, we think will be more and more of the volume and should continue to drive upside for us. The ICP portion of the revenue obviously changes from quarter-to-quarter. What we said is, it's roughly 20% to 25%-ish of our overall revenues based on what we sell to them directly.Douglas Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co.And just to clarify that because I've gotten the question as well, that includes DTN-X related revenues as well not just Cloud Xpress, correct?Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorCorrect.Douglas Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co.Okay. Great. And then if I can sneak one more quick one in, since this maybe last time you'll give it to us, can you talk about how many customers the Infinera business added during the quarter?Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorYeah, I think it's – Jeff you have to help me on this one, I think it's three new customers for Infinera.Douglas Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co.Great. Thank you.Jeff Hustis - Head-Investor RelationsThat is the last time we're going to go bring it in, you're right.Douglas Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co.Well, I appreciate it. Thanks.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorAll right.Jeff Hustis - Head-Investor RelationsAll right. Thanks Doug. Operator next question please.OperatorOur next question comes from James (50:28) of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.Unknown SpeakerHi, Mita (50:32) in for James (50:33). I understand that you're not going to break out Q4 guidance between Transmode and core Infinera, but can you give a sense of whether the strength is coming in from Metro or long-haul or data center? And then I have a follow-up question.Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerYeah, so Mita (50:49) we see strength across the portfolio quite frankly. There's areas within our long-haul business that continue to grow. The Metro business obviously is there for the full quarter, but continues to be strong, and obviously we expect Cloud Xpress to grow. So it's not any one area. We see good growth across the board.Unknown SpeakerAnd then just kind of a question on integration of the sales forces of Infinera and Transmode. How is the training kind of going on; is Infinera's selling Transmode products; is Transmode selling Infinera – how is that portfolio going in especially in products like XTC which might be kind of a fusion of those product lines, like is everybody selling everything so far?Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorYes, everybody is selling everything. I mean, the first thing as we said, what we want to do is create a unified company picture to our customers first. So the first thing we did was create training programs for consolidated field for both companies. We did one in North America, we did one in Europe, we did one in a APAC and we had both teams together for that. We've reorganized the sales force already under Bob Jandro, so there is no longer a separate Transmode sales team and Infinera sales team. There is one sales team and that's been mixed with people around accounts and markets and technologies.Clearly, it's going to take a little while for the Infinera people to get up to speed on the Transmode portfolio, and vice versa. But they are jointly selling products now and they are commissioned which is always important across what they sell, regardless of what they sell. And good sales guys, what they're very best at is figuring out how they can make money, and that's by selling a whole portfolio of our gear and Transmode's gear and everything else. So I'm actually very happy with how that's gone so far.Unknown SpeakerOkay. Great. Thank you guys.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorThanks.Jeff Hustis - Head-Investor RelationsThanks Mita (52:43). Next question.OperatorOur next question comes from Mr. Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.Ashwin X. Kesireddy - JPMorgan Securities LLCYeah hi, this is Ashwin on behalf of Rod. Thanks for taking my question. Sorry to continue to beat a dead horse here. But, Tom I don't think you mentioned any customer vertical where you saw these push-outs?Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorNo, we didn't, and we're not going to – and I don't want to make – have you guys make it a bigger deal than it is.Ashwin X. Kesireddy - JPMorgan Securities LLCAll right, fair enough. And as you were talking to your existing customer about Transmode products, can you give us a sense of whether you're seeing any pricing pressure, are customers asking for more discounts, is there something else which could probably accelerate the penetration of Transmode products into your customer base?David F. Welch - Co-Founder, President & DirectorYeah, this is Dave Welch. Almost all of our customers have Metro applications within the networks that we supply to them. They love the experience they've had with Infinera products and they are looking for an opportunity to extend that experience from them. In the Transmode product as well as the XTC-2 product line enables us to offer different solutions depending on what their OTN or packet fabric requirements are.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorBut the interesting thing is we are being invited to some pretty good RFQ's with this extended portfolio, so sometimes on these, the price bands hasn't started yet, but these are request for quotes that we would not have had an opportunity to participate in before, and I think that what people are looking for are vendors who can provide end-to-end solutions, a great quality experience, excellent customer support, superior technology today and into the future and aren't at risk of being consolidated out of the industry. So I think that all of these things are very positive, and I think that as Dave said, we will offer good value, but as people look for end-to-end networks, it is not really about how low can I go on this one box.David F. Welch - Co-Founder, President & DirectorI think it's worth reiterating on the number of a questions here. We sell a differentiated product. We sell a product that the customers value and they see that value and they're willing to give us a price to represent that value. We have a vertically integrated product line that allows us to make more targeted products, and it also allows us to do it in a structure that can generate differentiated gross margins for that. So our differentiated product and that experience, that continues to encourage them to take our product deeper and deeper into their networks.Ashwin X. Kesireddy - JPMorgan Securities LLCOkay. Great. Thanks, guys.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorThanks.Jeff Hustis - Head-Investor RelationsThanks. Next question?OperatorNext question comes from Ted of Barrington Research. Your line is now open.Theodore Joseph Moreau - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.Thank you for taking my questions. Tom, you had indicated there was a market study over the last several years, the Metro market was growing about 8% to 10% annually and seeing the same thing for next year. I was under the impression, and I think the markets under the impression that the Metro market is going to start accelerating with the 100 Gig. So are we thinking wrong there? I mean is the market just going to continue to grow steady state or are you actually seeing an inflection down the road where the Metro market is going to actually start to accelerate?David F. Welch - Co-Founder, President & DirectorYeah, I think – and this is Dave Welch again, I'll let Tom add on here. First let me clarify what these numbers that Tom referred to are total markets, we're talking about $5 billion rough markets between long-haul and Metro. The 100 Gig front portion of that market is growing at a subsequently faster rate in both the long-haul and in the Metro. We are targeting our – our technologies are greater differentiated for the 100 Gig aspect in the market and we expect that to grow faster and that's the aspect of the market that we're going to go after.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorYeah I think that at least what the data I've seen and Dave is absolutely correct that Metro will grow 8% to 10% next year off a slower rate this year. This year long-haul grew faster than Metro. The forecast is that next year Metro will grow aggregate faster than long-haul. And 100 Gig will grow substantively in Metro.Theodore Joseph Moreau - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.Okay. Thanks for clarifying. And then other question is, as you sell to the Web 2.0 guys over the next year, if you can look out may be six months or so, how do think your product mix to those guys shakes out among Cloud Xpress versus the new XTC-500 versus DTN-X. I mean, how do you see that shift or that mix breaking out?David F. Welch - Co-Founder, President & DirectorYeah, that market's – actually ICP market sector and related, they have network needs that range from subsea application to transcontinental application to across the street applications. The CX is designed for within the Metro distances. The XTC, although, satisfied some Metro applications, it's predominantly designed for high capacity long-haul, and then obviously our subsea solutions. The total bandwidth growth either directly through the ICPs or indirectly through the wholesalers or other market sectors is substantial across all of the applications.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorAnd I think the important thing to us isn't whether they buy Cloud or XT or DTN-X, we don't care as long as they are buying one of them. Now, what we're trying to do is create a portfolio of tools that is right for whatever application they might have. As Dave pointed out, they have a breadth of applications. I mean, they are the new Tier 1s of transport in my absolute convicted opinion. And what we want to do is make sure that we're providing the superior solution for whatever one application they need, and I just want to beat the other guy. I don't care which product of ours we sell.Theodore Joseph Moreau - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.Makes sense. Thanks a lot guys. Good luck.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorThank you.Jeff Hustis - Head-Investor RelationsThanks. Next question?OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Tim Quillin of Stephens Incorporation. Your line is now open.Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens, Inc.Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Just two quick ones, one as you look at the Transmode portfolio, is there a set of products or a portion of your existing customers, Infinera customers networks where you think you might have a Trojan horse that kind of gets your foot in the door on those cross-selling opportunities? And then second question, just today I think there has been some questions around the notion of some of those hyper scale data center operators maybe introducing White Box optical transport into their networks and whether that's from your perspective viable or not? Thanks.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorWell, certainly on the White Box transport I haven't heard that yet. I have not; and I talk to these guys, we talk to them a lot. We certainly see White Box switching, White Box and other things. But I think the Internet content guys are pretty savvy around optical; they've hired a number of our guys. So we talk to them a lot. And I have not seen or heard anything around White Box transport. I've certainly heard of White Box switches that they're looking to incorporate transport into, but that's more conceptual roadmap and I think there are a number of challenges in that arena. I still don't believe that the Internet content guys are going to go and re-create what they tried to do round switching around transport. We'll see, but I don't feel threatened by about at all.In regard to other Trojan horse applications, with our Transmode buying, yeah, we do think that there are some opportunities in specific applications that they bring to the market that we think that if we can get a first application; I mean Transmode has been extraordinarily good in their history of creating niche applications, designing very well for those, for margin, power, space, getting in the door and then leveraging those up. We plan on continuing to do that. We do see, I'm not going to talk about which ones specifically, some very good opportunities to potentially get into some customers that we have not been in with some of their capabilities, and we will try to do the same thing. Be very successful at this niche opportunity, and then leverage it into a great big opportunity over time. Transmode was very successful at that, and quite frankly, Infinera was very successful at that. That's why we think the Infinera experience sell so well, because once customers get a taste of it, they typically come back for more.Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens, Inc.Great. Thank you.Jeff Hustis - Head-Investor RelationsThanks Tim. We'll take one final question, operator.OperatorOkay. Our next question comes from Tim Savageaux of Northland Capital Markets. Your line is now open.Tim Savageaux - Northland Securities, Inc.Hi, glad I was able to make it on there and congratulations on a strong quarter.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorThanks Tim.Tim Savageaux - Northland Securities, Inc.I hesitate to ask a question related to somehow the misconstrued, but I see you've taken care of that for me to some degree with the pockets of weakness. But I did want to address another item that you mentioned about new opportunities arising as a result of the end-to-end portfolio that you've put together here. And specifically, whether that might also apply to – versus the new Tier 1s you mentioned, opportunities kind of at the old traditional Tier 1s, even perhaps opportunities at Tier 1s where you've substantially already won business in the past.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorYeah.Tim Savageaux - Northland Securities, Inc.And I wonder if these type of conversations can be refreshed, or you continue to target those larger traditional carriers or...Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorSure.Tim Savageaux - Northland Securities, Inc....you've turned your focus more towards the new guys.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorNo. We're targeting anybody who's spending any money and that's my preferred customer. We have been invited, for instance to, there's a wholesale Tier 1 that we do in Europe that we've had a very, very good relationship with, in their wholesale business, and we've never been invited into – quote, into their domestic network, because one of their rules is you have to have end-to-end. Not long after we did the Transmode deal, we were invited to, quote, on an end-to-end, within the PTT's domestic network. We haven't won yet, but we've now been invited in for the first time. I think that's a very good opportunity.There's another customer that we have that has been a long-term customer, mostly in subsea, and we are now talking with them around Transmode product that they are very interested in. They weren't interested in Transmode before, not because the technology wasn't good, but they just didn't need another vendor. So I think that that's a good opportunity. We have a large PTT, or Tier 1 in Mexico where both of us were independently selling to them, but more opportunistically versus strategically. I think we have the opportunity and the conversations are occurring of maybe we can move this into a strategic relationship. The exciting part to me is, this is, what, six weeks after the deal closed. This isn't six months or six years after it, its six weeks. So if this is any kind of indication, I think, like I said, we're going to look back and say, this was really a superb buy for us.Tim Savageaux - Northland Securities, Inc.Great. Thanks very much, and congrats once again.David F. Welch - Co-Founder, President & DirectorThanks Tim.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorThank you guys for joining us and for all your questions. Before I sign out, I want to give a little shout out to Charlie Strong and the Longhorns on their new winning streak. Hook 'em Horns until the next time. Have a great day.OperatorThank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.")
# 2015 q4
infn.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Michael"
            " Genovese of MKM Partners.Michael GenoveseThanks for the question. On the outlook for 1Q, on the down 6% sequentially, can you give us any color on the different product lines in terms of the TM Series versus the organic products, if one would be significantly different than the other in that sequential movement?Brad FellerMike, it’s an overall thing, it’s not one product or another, it’s just the dynamic in the industry that it takes customers time to get their budgets finalized and get POs [ph] to us. We feel like the underlying demand is good, it’s just getting those orders in, that kind of stuff but it’s not unique to any one product.Michael GenoveseAnd can you kind of go into some detail about couple of balance sheet items. I mean deferred revenue is way up and inventory is also a significant increase, it looks like finished goods oriented, I mean does that suggest visibility or problem, what is it?Brad FellerYes. So our deferred revenue in the fourth quarter, Mike, is always higher because we have our maintenance renewals in the fourth quarter, so that’s really the thing that’s driving that, and as our installed base obviously gets bigger, that becomes a bigger number. If you look at the inventory side of things, obviously we are releasing quite a few new products, as we go into this year. So it’s really just making sure that we have the right amount of supply to capture the opportunity in front of us.Tom FallonMike, this is Tom. I’d really encourage you not to imply that inventory is because of lack of visibility. Over the last year what we’ve said pretty consistently is we’re going to try to bring back our lead times into being shorter, they’ve creeped out over the year and we’ve made a very very methodological attack on lead times. To do that, you do need particularly as your product line grows, some more inventory to do that. We’ve got now our lead times in a very very good position, particularly as we are working hard on the internet content provider space, whereas sometimes the planning is less – you get less forecasts than you would like and we are committed to solving those problems, unlike some of these competitors, we don’t have one or two quarters’ worth of backlog. We try to respond very quickly to orders as they come in, we believe it’s a compelling advantage for our customers and we believe it’s a compelling advantage for us, particularly in this space.Michael GenoveseAnd if I could just follow up on my first question on the Transmode side of the world. I heard a lot in the beginning comments about RFPs. I didn’t hear as much detail as I would have liked to hear, I think just because you didn’t give it about actual cross-selling successes to date. Is there anything there that you can point to even if just in general terms?Tom FallonRFPs include both new customers, both of us and also cross selling proposals and what you should really focus on quite frankly is, are we seeing more opportunities? We are seeing a lot more opportunities for Transmode gear than Transmode did independently, that’s good. A lot of that is because it’s going into potential Infinera customers and one of the things I am going to caution everybody about is it’s easy to think, oh, Infinera already has these customers, gosh, selling them something new would be really easy. It might be easy but it’s going to take time. You have to quote it, you’ve got to explain it, they have to test it, they have to have an application. I don’t think we’re going to see, as I said I think in the commentary, I have every belief the synergies we thought we were going to happen, or are on track to happen, but it’s probably a second half of this year before you really see the pull-through of these synergies.OperatorAnd the next question comes from George Notter of Jefferies.George NotterI guess just maybe to start by sort of the economic environment that we are in, I mean going through the earnings season, lots of commentary from a variety of IT infrastructure companies about softening in emerging markets and customers slowing at quarter end. I mean, are you seeing any of that from your customer base, what’s the perspective there?Tom FallonYes, again my perspective, George and I think I am not an economist, I don’t understand a lot of the things that some of these people are talking about describing behaviours. I am sure they are real and they are creating concerns. But what I see are a couple of dynamics. I see a permanent move to the cloud architectures, that’s not slowing down, and that’s going to be good for our industry and our company. And I see a non-slowdown in the requirements that our customers see on bandwidth. And regardless of what’s happening in China, regardless of who is going to be the President, regardless of what the dollar does, strengthening or weakening, if there is demand for bandwidth, we’re going to go do well. And I was just in PTC, a conference that happens every year in our industry, and I met a dozen customers or so, and usually you meet with them and there is a smettering of issues, your price is too high, I want this feature. That was one consistent theme from every single customer at this time and it’s never happened before, whether it’s from Europe customer, American customer, APAC customer, they see demand and that’s what they were interested in talking about, how can we help them win deals because the demand environment for bandwidth is exceptionally good. That is to me trumps everything else that’s happening on the world stage, and I think that we are excited about that which is why we are trying to make sure we have short lead times. And one dynamic we are seeing this quarter, which is a little different, lot of our customers build based upon plans, they methodically build out capacity, and we are seeing some set of customers starting to do buy or win, meaning, if they win a deal they are buying from us. They are doing less structured internet buildouts but they are aggressively going after bandwidth demand opportunities and they are coming to us with quick lead times. Does that give us a little bit less visibility? It does, but it’s a great advantage for us because we use time as a weapon. And I think it’s a great thing that our customers are seeing demand and whether they are building structurally or building opportunistically, as long as they’re going to Infinera, I don’t care.George NotterAnd one follow up I had, I guess I was curious about Cloud Xpress in Q4, I guess, if you go back you guys at one point said 30 million to 60 million was kind of range for Cloud Xpress and then I think you were kind of pointing to lower end of that range. I mean, I’d love to get an update on kind of where Cloud Xpress look out [ph] for the year and what kind of momentum you are seeing in terms of traction with revenue?Tom FallonYes, it played out in the range that we had said, as we said it got off to a slower start than we thought because of certifications which I still believe are architecturally important and put us in a great position, and I will give a little comment on Q1. The momentum that was building near the end of the year has actually accelerated in Q1 for the Cloud Xpress product. It’s actually in Q1 so far exceeding our expectations, and that’s what we thought would happen, it’s architectural win, it’s a proof point in the industry and even though a number of competitors have announced competing products, we are really not seeing them impact the market yet. We feel like we’ve got a real winner with the CX family.Brad FellerYes, George, to Tom’s comments, we obviously continue to add more and more customers and the types of customer that can be very meaningful over time, so I think that’s another good proof point. And then the adoption for the 100G product that we released in Q3 was nice in Q4 as well.OperatorAnd the next question will come from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank.Vijay BhagavathTom, I have a bigger picture strategy question for you and then a follow up for Brad. A question for you, Tom, is what is the sustainable modes around Infinera’s business? I get this question asked a lot from clients especially in recent marketing meetings. And where they are coming from and where I am coming from is you have Cisco, Juniper, maybe some of the web 2.0 customers of yours looking to enter the 100 G data center optical market, the stage could get quite crowded honestly heading into next year, so the question really is how do you maintain your competitive advantage, your differentiation, your mode and also your pricing power in a crowded market heading into next year?Tom FallonI am assuming a comment from Dave who is much more astute in technology than I am – I answer, first of all, it’s important that you talk to people about this crowded market, there is a huge difference of people announcing products for sale, and actually selling products that solve problems. Over a half a dozen people have announced our products for sale and we’re fundamentally seeing almost nobody actually delivering those products. They know it’s sexy, they know it’s important, but there is a technology barrier to getting in there, that’s non-trivial. How we sustain our advantages, I will let Dave comment.Dave WelchFirst, our business is the management of the services we’re able to win and the optics are critical to maintain it and differentiated optics are critical in maintaining that and Tom alluded in his commentary that it is critically important if you want to plan on playing in this space that you maintain a position of differentiated optics for that. The PIC is a horse we are riding on that and that continues to show and continues to dominate the supply of wavelength out there. We are running at around 30% of total 100G wavelengths deployed in the long haul, when we were at the 10G market we supplied 48% of all 10Gs deployed in the long haul for many years, and that’s because that optical technology is what differentiates it. The ability to add services be it the layer 1, layer 2 or even layer 3 as the optics are what can ultimately differentiate your ability to manage those services across that and we have a unique distinct advantage.Tom FallonIt’s important – I agree with everything Dave said, it’s important that the optics that create this differentiation, it’s vertically owned IP from both an intellectual property perspective and the manufacturing perspective and we believe that is mandatory and we do not see people going after that to disrupt our leadership there, and in fact, as I said, we announced our next generation Terabit technology this year. Our gap is widening on our capabilities versus the industry’s capabilities.Dave WelchThe industry is also in the midst of voting, that’s really the thing that they need to – are comfortable breaking on, are the higher layer services, and the ability to manage our layer 2 or layer 3 functionality from a greater diversity of players as it leads a tremendous opening for a company like ourselves to go in and add those capabilities to our transport boxes. What you don’t see is the ability to virtualize differentiated optics.Vijay BhagavathJust a quick follow on for Brad, the case that Brad argues, there could be gross margin distraction, as you sell more diverse set of products, Metro, DCI, long haul and on and on, so help us understand from your lens how would you manage gross margins as your product portfolio and SKU –Brad FellerVijay, obviously our guidance continues to show margin continuing to expand, so I know there is people that don’t necessarily want to – don’t think that that’s going to happen, but we do have a differentiated approach to the market. We are very selective in the deals that we take. We have the leverage of the vertical integration and there is multiple dynamics to our business that will continue to allow us to expand margin. We said over time we can get to 50% gross margin. I still believe that is the case and I am confident we will get there over time.OperatorAnd next we have a question from Alex Henderson of Needham & Company.Alex HendersonFirst, can you just give us a quick update on your tax rate expectations now that the R&D tax credit has been passed and made permanent? What does that do to your tax rate?Brad FellerAlex, in ’16 it shouldn’t change our tax rate, we will still be in a full evaluation launch position for ’16. Out in ’17 as we’ve talked about, we will – our taxes will go up as we continue to be more and more profitable, but we are working on that. I can’t give really any specifics at this time.Alex HendersonWell, would it lower a little bit or would it change?Brad FellerYes, I mean it may lower a bit.Alex HendersonSecond question, there is a lot of concern about the 6% growth rate guidance that you [ph] gave but it sounds like a lot of that 6% had more to do with revenue recognition timing associated with some large contract deployments that have happens a criteria [ph] on them. There is an assumption that you would also see that but on the other hand, you intend to be putting a line extensions to existing customers but you’ve already got the DTN-X certified in their network. So do you think that deferred revenue acceptance would slow down the timing of Metro for recognition – would be less than – please?Tom FallonI’ve got no commentary on Seina [ph] business, you need to ask them on their questions. I can tell you what I think. I think that the long haul market is going to grow, 6% to 8% a year and we’re going to grow our market share. I think Metro is going to grow, we’re going to grow our market share. DCI is going to grow, we’re going to grow our market share. And I don’t think rev break is going to materially alter how we – on our ability to build this business over the next couple of years. That just doesn’t bother me.We have three weeks or four weeks worth of backlog, they got half a year, it’s a different model. I don’t understand theirs, they probably don’t understand ours. But you need to not to club us together.OperatorAnd next we have a question from Sanjiv Wadhwani of Stifel.Sanjiv WadhwaniA couple of questions from my end. Brad, first one for you, if you look at the operating margin guidance for Q1, I think it was around 11, 11.5% or somewhere around there. But I guess with your OpEx ramping, how should we think about operating margins for the full year, you’ve expanded that really nicely 2013 into 2014, and into 2015. So should we still look at operating margins expanding this year versus last year?Brad FellerI mean we are not going to provide guidance for the full year, Sanjiv. The reason it’s down in Q1 is obviously the revenue being a little bit lighter and us investing based on the full year and the future and not just our Q1. So I think we will still deliver strong operating margins, the reality is I think if we are able to even maintain what we’ve done is a good result. The reality is after you’ve had multiple years of increasing it, several hundred basis points a year, it’s really tough to maintain.Tom FallonAnd one of the things that you guys need to be careful of, we have consistently said our R&D is going to run 20% of revenue because we’ve grown so quickly that [ph] achieving that and your industry continues to model us at less than 20%, and it always perplexes me. We’re going to run R&D at 20%.Sanjiv WadhwaniI think investors just want to listen, that’s the bottom line. Second question is, just on the Metro side, Tom, you talked about Transmode, just curious to see what the initial feedback on your core organic Metro product, what kind of transaction are you seeing and should we be expecting sort of a second half ramp and pick up over there?Dave WelchAs you indicate, DTN-Xs, Infinera’s product line has had a good position within Metro and that continues to be the case, and actually what we find very encouraging is that our customers that use our IQ NOS operating system continuing to want to be – to take advantage of the ease of use and the completeness of that operating system. So we’re going to see continued Metro growth of both the XEC based products as well as we grow the TM underneath of our network management and DNA [ph] capabilities, we will be able to grow that even further with having the added value of our IQ NOS software.Brad FellerJust to add to that, Sanjiv, given what Tom mentioned earlier about timing to get things into network and the test cycles that kind of stuff, it is going to be more of a second half type of impact.Sanjiv WadhwaniOne last question, Brad, for you, on seasonality. It looks like last year or year before you kind of booked seasonality, you are looking at some seasonality in Q1 better than industry but still some seasonality. Any change in sort of the seasonal patterns Q2 through Q4 that we should be aware of?Brad FellerI don’t think so.Tom FallonI just think the bigger we get the more we’re going to be part of any kind of industry seasonality. We have been fortunate to have escaped the last couple of years, kind of holding flat but when the industry spends roughly 14% less quarter on quarter we’re just large enough now, that we’re going to be part of that.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Rod Hall of JPMorgan.Unidentified AnalystThis is AK [ph] on behalf of Rod. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could comment on 100G Metro build out plan by telecom carriers, what are your expectations for that?Brad FellerWe continue to see growth in the deployment of 100G in the Metro, it’s pretty much as we had talked about throughout the ’15, as ’16 is a timeframe which we think that will start accelerating. The majority of services out there in the Metro right now are still 10G but they are making decisions based on your capability of supplying of 100G to the market and we are seeing a pickup in interest and a pickup in deployment but it’s going to be later in ’16 before you see that starting to accelerate.OperatorNext question comes from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley.Meta MarshallHi this is Meta Marshall for James. A couple of questions. First, there was kind of a jump in CapEx and as we understand this kind of investment for Transmode, but is there a level of cash cost we should be expecting or period of elevated CapEx? And then second, I know you mentioned the competitors like Arista entering the DCI market and not having the pull, sort of capabilities, given you guys had a partnership with them, just how that partnership has evolved?Brad FellerI will address the CapEx and then let Tom or Dave address Arista. We target our CapEx at 5% on an annual basis, that’s for the entire business, that’s not just getting Transmode up to speed whatever, that’s across our vertical integration and that kind of stuff. So we were little bit higher in the fourth quarter but still in line with our 5% for the year, so that’s how you should model going forward.Tom FallonIn regard to competitors, we’re going to always see new sets of competitors whether it’s Cisco or Arista incorporating optics into their platform or Juniper buying BTI, and I think that’s a normal part of any healthy industry where there is a big opportunity. And my belief with Arista particularly they are good partners of ours. So we joint sell together, sometimes we win with them, sometimes we don’t, sometimes they are going to create opportunities to have an integrated platform, that will be potentially advantageous for very short reach kind of optics, but my take is we have a huge toolbox of vertical IP around optics and we’re just going to be better than anybody else who integrates optics into their platform. So that’s what we are going to go do and quite frankly if they or anybody else can do better optics than us, we’ve got to better challenge than Arista competing with BTI. I think there is a fascination right now with optical and I think it’s really a strong statement for our position in the market. Arista is putting optics into their platforms, I believe, not because they want to be in the optical business but they want to have more customer controls, the same reason that Cisco does. I look at Juniper buying BTI for the same reason. I think that they are all trying to have customer control of networks and architectures but if you don’t do it from an intellectual property base that allows ongoing sustainable competitive advantage I think you are going to have a really hard time being successful there. It’s what we do, day and night, it’s all we do. So I don’t worry about that as being competition, I will work with any of them who are interested in solving customer problems with us, otherwise we will just go ahead and beat them in the market either way.OperatorThe next question comes from Simon Leopold of Raymond James.Simon LeopoldI wanted to talk a little bit more about what’s going on in the metro space. First starting with a clarification in that, in your prepared remarks you mentioned the core revenue growth which leads me to calculate the Transmode contribution through the fourth quarter at something around 27 million. Wanted to see if I am doing my math correctly if that’s what you intended. And then more broadly, I’d like to get a better understanding of what you expect metro to be as a contribution to the full year, so maybe as a percentage of total sales or something like that, given that it’s hard to apply growth rates because of the acquisition and new products, you’re obviously easily growing faster than the market on a year over year comparison. So maybe we could term in terms of percent of revenue you consider coming from metro in 2016?Brad FellerSo Simon, we didn’t break out the specific on the Transmode piece. We did say that there is a full year’s impact of those revenues – the partial quarter in Q3. The thing to remember those are, our metro business is broader than just the TM series that we bought from Transmode. So it is a bit bigger than you noted in your response but metro grew, DCI grew, and long haul grew as well. As a percentage of total sales I mean you can look at Transmode being the biggest piece, you can look at what they have done historically. Obviously as that business ramps up, that will become a larger percentage but we expect the overall business to grow as well. So it will probably be to the second half of the year before we can break out a specific what you should expect for the metro business.OperatorThe next question is from Dmitry Netis of William Blair.Dmitry NetisI have a quick sort of housekeeping item and then more a general question. On the housekeeping side, as I look in the press release, I think you guys had two 10% plus customers at least, if I am reading it correctly. And I think Brad you said there was one on the call. So I am just trying to reconcile that.Brad FellerYes, two for the year, one for Q4.Dmitry NetisAnd then Tom, so you on the Web scale cautiousness you expressed in the third quarter, can you talk about whether that’s dissipated now, that eye had done away, you certainly noted that ICP being strong and up sequentially and also year over year. It will be great if you can qualify how much they were up sequentially at least year over year or whichever you like to tackle, but that question on the web scale kind of commentary last quarter and then the ICP growth which if I remember is 20%, 25% of your revenues, correct?Tom FallonI don’t know if we’ve broken out. I don’t remember what my cautionary comment on ICP was, Web scale guys was last quarter. If I was cautionary at all it’s to try to maybe move some of the expectations that I think people, analysts get run away with the expectations. As I recall last quarter, analysts were worried about spending from the ICPs going down and I said I didn’t see that, and I still don’t see that, and I continue to – and recently on a number of the large guys had come out and said they are increasing their CapEx. And I think sometimes too much focus is on the number or word CapEx which covers a huge number of things, and people need to continue to focus more and more on bandwidth, is bandwidth growing or not, and I continue to see large web-scale guys putting in very very large infrastructure and buying a lot of bandwidth and I think an area that’s often missed by analysts is how much wholesale and enterprise carriers are carrying internet content by content, it’s staggering and I said on the call that our business with that market doubled last year. That is carrying a lot of internet content guys traffic.So we see great presence in the enterprise and wholesale carrier market. We have great presence and a growing presence both for long haul and cloud interconnect with the data center guys and the ICPs, and so I remain optimistic on our position there and on the demand in that market. There have been a number of people who have come out and said that we’re going to go and enter that market competitively, that’s clearly something we need to watch. To my surprise very few people are delivering products there now. So that’s been a positive surprise. I anticipated a quarter ago, there was going to be maybe four or five platforms that would actually be in the market to date, I don’t see them yet. So that’s good news and we see, as I said on the call, or the earlier question, our CX business actually this quarter is growing faster than it’s grown. So I am not cautious really on that market any more but I don’t remember being cautious on it in Q3.Dmitry NetisIs there any way you can qualify the enterprise wholesale piece of the business [indiscernible]?Brad FellerSo as we said Dmitry, we have multiple different businesses that we operate in multiple verticals, that are similar size. Obviously as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, ICPs and bandwidth wholesalers are growing faster and grew faster in ’15. So you can – I let you do your math from there.OperatorThe next question comes from Doug Clark of Goldman Sachs.Douglas ClarkI want to follow up on one previously about kind of the competitive mode landscape. Just wondering as you move into the metro market where perhaps one terabit PICs aren’t as necessary or in high demand as the long haul portion of the network. On what aspect do you think you can differentiate in these new markets that you’re moving into, particularly in kind of the service provider or metro?Tom FallonI’d go back to our phone call back in -- what was that – August, September around Transmode. Transmode was a market share – one of the market share leaders in Europe with their platform and they are there because they are offering both not only a complete set of services from the agent through the metro core capability but because they are able to give the lowest power, lowest size offering to meet that market space, and they were very successful of that. We expect to continue to take advantage of that, we’re seeing successes from that approach, philosophy and technologies in the front haul market, we’re seeing successes of that in the cable market, we’re seeing successes in Europe and in North America, and as we bring that to the strength of Infinera customer space, we expect that to continue to grow.What’s important is to be able to create an end to end service from your access points all the way out through your high capacity cores. There is -- as we said it before, there is absolutely a place for a PIC inside the TM platform, we plan on pursuing that in order to drive space power density advantages as well as to take advantage of our instant bandwidth capabilities that we offer, and expand it into the metro and complement that with the low power consuming well designed low latency solutions of the access technologies that Transmode has.Brad FellerDoug, I’d be careful thinking that our only PIC we’re doing to do is the one terabit PIC. As we talked about over the last year we are coming up now with multiple favors of PIC including PICs that can be sliceable in its smaller granularity which will we think play very nicely into the metro market.Tom FallonI also think – we do think about technologies for the long term and it’s important for us to deliver technologies that have a direct meaning over the next year or two, but it’s also important that we continue to develop technologies that have applications for driving improvement in network capabilities over the many years. And I won’t be surprised if my kids have terabits to their homes, so we shouldn’t assume that that’s not going to be an application technology for metro.Dave WelchA point of interest and point out the government target is to get to a megabit per student in every school. You had that up quickly and you realize the type of bandwidth that it needs to get out there and the government incentives to be able to achieve that especially for low income areas which aren’t on the network right away. The bandwidth is going into the – I think the number I head earlier today from a customer is about, there is still a small fraction of the number of people on the internet today compared to the number of houses that are passed, and as these incentives to be able to drive the megabits to each of the school student and the respective families associated with that, is going to drive the bandwidth in the metro markets up substantially.Douglas ClarkAnd then my follow up was more on the first quarter guidance, you talked about the impact of timing of budget releases and the finalization of that, and a month and half into the quarter half way through, are those budgets actually being released, are you seeing spending come unlocked, or is it still the anticipation of that to come?Brad FellerYes, we are starting to see that unlocked, Doug, but there’s still – we get a budget done and basically you have to create those POs, that you get those POs to us, we have to deliver the gear as to get installed. So that’s where there is still a little bit of uncertainty in what happens in the quarter in Q1 because it is – tend to cause issues going later in the quarter.Tom FallonI want to add a little clarity. Budgets are being released et cetera but we wouldn’t have guided to 245 if we couldn’t touch in the field 245, so I don’t want you to read that there is – we take the guide very very seriously. So we’re not depending upon budgets being released that we aren’t aware of yet.OperatorAnd the next question is from Stanley Kovler of Citi Research.Stanley KovlerI have a clarification question just on the international organic growth. From the math there, it looks like when we back out Transmode you had something like 17% year over year growth, international markets, and if you can just help us understand some of the drivers there with your web customers, building out a lot of the data centers in Europe, how much are you seeing of that versus true European based customers, growing there? And the follow up is just to update us on your plans to give some more formal model to think about on margin, something you alluded to in the prior call?Brad FellerSo Stan, it’s a combination of things that’s driving the international growth obviously. You mentioned the Transmode side, but we do have a very good base of customers throughout Europe who are building, we also see the ICPs whether it’s the phenomenon that Tom talked about where the enterprise and wholesale carriers are building for the ICPs in Europe or the ICPs building themselves in Europe, there has been relative strength around each of those different areas and if you go broader internationally we’ve talked for several quarters now about the LATAM market being one that we are getting traction not only with the bigger carriers down there but seeing bigger global customers wanting to build more footprint in that region.If you go to your second question around the formal model, we’ve talked about being mid this year we will come out with that model. I think that still is on track to be the case, as we finalize what we see with different products, they get more and more familiar with the Transmode side of the business but we feel very good about the 50, 15 we talked about over time.Stanley KovlerIf I can just – a follow up, what was the traction with some of the new products you came with in early Q4 XTC series and things like that? And if you can help us differentiate between the visibility you are seeing between your US based customers and what you are seeing in the international market as well, how that’s impacting the guidance?Brad FellerSo the products that we talked about and our launch we’re coming out in Q4 centered around our offering of XTC2, small size chassis or 100G PIC based line card, that’s within that, we’re seeing orders come in for that, we’re happy with that. I think the interest of that product line on the basis of our overall operating system or IQ NOS, IQ network operating system, is going to be a winner, we’re very happy with the progress so far.Tom FallonWe’re also seeing good interest with the XT-500, it’s a new approach to long haul. We have some software release that we have found is going to be an interesting addition to it that some customers are now waiting for, and we’re seeing some traction with the XT-500 but I think that once we come out with these new features in the middle of the year we’re going to create a new application that I am extraordinarily pumped up about, the CX 100 as we talked about earlier, selling like cupcakes. So overall we see a good pipeline of new products, we see a lot of early activity with them and usually it takes six to nine months before it really has a meaningful revenue kind of impact.OperatorThe next question comes from Tim Savageaux of Northland Capital.Tim SavageauxAnd that’s kind of where my question is focused, which is obviously there is not just them, several of your peers even Nokia this morning talking about the pronounced seasonal weakness or just general double digit down sequential guide, and I’d say what’s notable about your performance is you’re much better than that. I would imagine given the CX commentary that you are going to see sequential growth through seasonality from Cloud Xpress, and I wondered if you might be able to comment on when you see that getting to a 10% of revenue type level, I would imagine mid-16.Tom FallonI am not going to comment on that. Our whole business is growing very rapidly. The CX product line obviously is growing faster than our overall business but I want to make sure you understand we’re going to grow in long haul, we’re going to grow in metro, we’re going to grow in data center interconnect, and do I forecast that business being 10% of our company at some point, certainly I do. But I think it’s more important than anyone product offering is, are we winning market share in a market that is growing and we are doing that in all areas. And I think one of the things that I am never going to want to have happened, I don’t want my guys selling CX products to be competing with my guys selling Transmode products. Large companies have those problems. They think that they got to not only beat the outside guy but the inside guy. I just want to solve customers’ problems in the most economic way possible, I don’t care if they buy TM or a CX or DTN-X or XT, the beautiful thing we have right now is an entire portfolio of technologies to solve customer problems in a way that is economically excellent for us because we are building purpose built platforms and I think it’s just really important for the industry to look at, are we growing market share in a growing market? If we can continue to do that, it doesn’t get better than that, unless you are vertically integrated and can scale that to profit which we can. So I am really excited about where we are at. And I am less excited about which product that we’re going to sell.Tim SavageauxIf I can follow up back on the last call there was some comment around pockets of weakness, really I don’t think you were specifically referring to cloud at all, but maybe I was taken to speak to maybe the cable guys or – CenturyLink is doing a bit better but any way no commentary about pockets of weakness this time but more normal seasonality, I mean do you have – you kind referenced that it was sort of a broad cautionary comment but to the extent you were referring to anything specific last time, what are you seeing now I guess?Tom FallonI think last time we didn’t comment on really pockets of weakness, what we commented on was a couple of customers pushed out orders that they had wanted in Q4 and they pushed them out to Q1. And I made the commentary because it was unusual, they weren’t gigantic of course but they weren’t small orders either, and they were customers who have a presence in the world that matters, and to me it was a question, was this in the first sign of something more systemic, and at this point in time, I believe it was not something that was more systemic. But if you do see the industry a little bit, it is changing. We’ve seen a couple – certainly people whether it’s LinkedIn or Twitter or people having challenging business right now and I think that does cause people to tactically to try to optimize their spend rates. I don’t think it fundamentally alters their strategy, I don’t think it fundamentally alters the infrastructure that they are putting in place that they deal with higher transmission requirements. But it does – necessarily try to optimize around when I am deploying that capital and I think that we’ve seen some of that. I think we’re going to continue seeing some of that as some of the changing landscape, there is good news about lot of these, I think for people who are serving bandwidth. I hate to see the companies that had difficulties but candidly in Silicon Valley, I am anticipating it’s going to be a little bit easier to hire people for a while, because there is going to be more caution than some of these companies that have to prove their valuation. We are a company that is growing, we are structurally growing profitability, we continue to add to hire and I am hoping that this allows us the ability to continue to attract many people.End of Q&AOperatorThis concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Fallon for any closing remarks.Tom FallonThanks everyone for joining us this afternoon for your questions. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress. Have a great day.OperatorThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.")
# 2016 q1
infn.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you. Your first question comes from the line of George Notter with"
            " Jefferies. Please go ahead.George C. Notter - Jefferies LLCHey, thanks a lot, guys. I guess I wanted to sort of dig in on this discussion of lumpiness that you're seeing in the business right now. Can you tell us anymore in terms of what exactly you're looking at? How many customers are we talking about here? Is this a reflection of any kind of product development issues or overhang ahead of the pending availability of the 2.4-terabit capability? Sorry for all the questions here. But...Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorThat's okay, George. You want some understanding. I got it.George C. Notter - Jefferies LLCYeah. I mean, is this related to certain products, long-haul, metro, Cloud Xpress? Is it related to certain customer types? I mean, any more you can kind of give us would be great.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorSo I'll walk you through probably more detail than I usually give because it is an interesting time. The overall environment, as I said on the call, I still see a huge amount of bandwidth demand. So I don't think that there's anything fundamental in the industry that's causing a problem.I also think when I look at the business environment, it's neither great nor bad. It's kind of an okay environment. We see customers deploying. We don't see any kind of freeze on things. But there have been a couple of areas that are stronger and some weaker than others.So on a strong perspective, Q1 bookings, for instance, in the long-haul market was the best bookings quarter we've had in a couple of years. For the CX product, we had record revenue and bookings in Q1. Both of those spaces did very well.In the metro market, I would call this – we've had a mixed kind of quarter. We picked up new customers as you've seen. We announced today a really significant cross-selling opportunity. We've announced two of the three wireless front-haul architectural wins that we announced. We picked up several new smaller customers. But we have one significant metro customer who has historically been part of the Transmode customer base and who hasn't bought for about two quarters. And there's nothing, I don't believe, that's structural there around the relationship. We believe that there is a big opportunity for us in the next quarter or so. There's an opportunity that's been driven to them by one of their customers, and I think they get back on track soon. Having said that, it's a big enough customer that it's really tough to backfill that in the short term.North America was pretty strong in general. I continue to see it being strong. Europe was reasonable. LatAm and APAC were a little bit softer than usual and a little bit softer than we had anticipated, though I don't think it's anything more than timing. So that's kind of where the overall business looks. I think overall, like I said, a pretty healthy.One of the things that rattles around in my concern list is we've seen over the last couple of weeks Ericsson had a pretty concerning, I guess, result. Juniper's pre-announced. Both Microsoft and I guess Google kind of missed expectations. And I have a little bit of pensiveness around me until I see more results of what's happening in the broader market.As I talk to the suppliers who sell us optical components, they're kind of calling it an okay environment too, except for China which is extraordinarily strong. So I think China continues to drive a huge amount of component demand, and they're seeing the rest of the world just be okay, which is kind of where I see the world as being okay.We talk to industry analysts. They're still forecasting the overall (29:44) market to grow somewhere in the 7% to 9% range for the year. That's reasonable growth. That's kind of been what it's been for the last few years. And if you look at our Q2 guide, it's kind of up – certainly below our expectations, below street expectations, but it's up quarter-on-quarter 4%. If the industry is growing 7% to 8%, that's not a terrible result. We're still gaining market share. It's terrible from the perspective of what I think we can do and will do, but it's not a terrible result. So that's a fairly long answer, George, and that's about all the detail I can give you. I don't know if that helps or not.George C. Notter - Jefferies LLCGot it. So, that's super helpful. One quick follow-up. So if I were to parse the delta relative to, I guess, pre-expectations for June, is it fair to say that most of the difference comes from this particular customer on the Transmode side or is that just one smaller component?Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorI'd say most, but not all. There are other things that are less dramatic as a percentage basis, but that's, I would say on a percentage basis, the most significant one.George C. Notter - Jefferies LLCOkay. Thank you.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham. Please go ahead.Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLCThanks. I think that was very helpful discussion, but could you parse a little bit between the product and the installation services side of it? This variance in the quarter for us was on service, and so are we going to see a continuation of that? In other words, a fairly slow service and a little bit more skew to product in the quarter as you fill line cards and the like?Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerYeah. So, Alex, Q1 is normally a softer quarter for us for services because the deployment services tend to be smaller in Q1 because it just takes time for customers to finalize their budgets, purchase it, get it installed. So a lot of that revenue carries over and doesn't get recognized in Q1. So that's just more of a Q1 dynamic.Obviously, if we talked about two other dynamics within services, one, as the installed base grows, the services revenues grow. But we are in a phase that it's more capacity adds versus new networks. So those two things will counteract each other a bit.Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLCSo the guidance for the June quarter is more biased to product than normal and the seasonal swing in service is probably less – is more dampened than normal?Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerYeah, I mean it's obviously services 10% to 15% of our revenues. So it's more of our product issue than it is a services issue that we're seeing from the revenue side of things.Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLCOkay. Thank you.Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerThanks.OperatorOur next question comes from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.Yeah. Hey, thanks. Hey, Tom, hi, Brad.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorHi, Vijay.Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.Hi. So it's a solid execution in Q1. It's been a rough start of the year for many of your peers. So congratulations on the better-than-fair Q1. A question for you and a follow-up if I may. The question is on Transmode starting to hit the U.S. market, your U.S. customers. Help us understand the Transmode dynamics in the U.S. Do you have a design win pipeline already in place with some of the major cable companies, et cetera? And would the third quarter be earliest in terms of getting revenues from these U.S. customers for Transmode? Thanks.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorSo we certainly have a pipeline of opportunities that we're developing with North America customers. The Telia announcement we made today is actually for their North America network. Telia's been a long-term Infinera partner. I believe we have 100% of their international North America backbone and now we're going to move into their metro. And it's interesting because, obviously, Telia is headquartered in Stockholm, which is where Transmode is headquartered. But they were unable to craft a deal until we acquired them. And because of our great relationship with Telia we've now become an end-to-end supplier in the North American network. It's one of our – it's not our first cross-sell opportunity, but it's one of our more important ones because it demonstrates we're dealing with a Tier 1 international carrier, that they value this end-to-end performance, they value the Infinera relationship, and they have confidence in us delivering that Infinera experience to them.We continue to do a reasonable amount of growth in North America, and I believe in the metro for the Transmode product, most of the growth will come out of North America. We are investing heavily and as you know we have a significant portion of our customers and our revenue come from North America historically. And I view a number of these as being potential TM-Series extensions of DTN-X networks. We're in different phases of trial, some with cable, some with wholesaler, some with – I can't remember if there's other markets we're those other markets enterprise through channels.So there's a number of deals that we're working on with our current customers to see if they will pick them. I think that, as I said, these take a long time because you have to not only find the right opportunity; you have to convince them that you are a compelling value proposition, and you've got to convince them to displace somebody that's already there. So it doesn't happen overnight. I still believe we'll have a better sign or a better understanding of the opportunity in the second half of this year and that's where I think these cross-selling opportunities will start kicking in. But I do believe North America represents our best avenue for growth for that product offering.Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.Then a quick follow-up, Tom, is just a bigger picture question, that a landmark moment for the company would be starting to sell into the major U.S. telcos such as Verizon, AT&T. You think your entry point into Verizon or in AT&T would be the metro product or would it be like the data center optical product? Thanks.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorWell, we – no, we constantly are working to sell to those guys. I think there's a number of potential opportunities. There's wireless fronthaul opportunities with our Transmode product. I mentioned that we've run three, and we're actually in trials or labs with another half a dozen or so. I'm not going to mention which ones they are, but they're significant carriers. I think that cable represents – I mean, sorry, CX represents opportunities potentially for the carriers, AT&T and Verizon. And quite frankly, there's interest in our solution around SDN. So we're going to continue to work very hard to earn their business.Having said all that, I just want to remind people my view. We're building a great business with or without the AT&Ts and Verizons. I think we can continue to grow this business faster than the market because the people who are investing the most in network are the Internet content guys, the cable guys, and the wholesale and enterprise carriers and that's our – we are best positioned. I want the business. I want to earn the business. It will help us grow. We don't need it to grow.Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.Okay. Thanks, Tom. Very helpful.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorThanks, Vijay.OperatorThe next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.Great. Thank you for taking my question. So, I wanted to first see if I could clarify the sort of sources of weakness in terms of your commentary. It sounds like you're pointing to sort of two aspects. One is lumpiness in long-haul, but somewhat softer metro. And I want to get a better understanding of that softness in metro. How much of that is sort of Transmode-related and how much of that is traction on the new XTC platform?And then in terms of kind of the longer-term trend, your exposure to ISPs' web-scale. I believe in the past you've talked about that as being 20%, 25% of revenue. I want to make sure I've got that number right. And if you could talk to how you expect that trend evolves over the course of the next, let's say, one to two years, thank you.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorYeah. So, two questions. I'm going to take the first part on is it the TM-Series from Transmode of the XTC-2 family that we introduced. And they're two different things. So the TM, I think the softness that I talked about specifically with that one significant customer is a TM issue. And the challenge is that as we're trying to win these and are winning cross-sell opportunities, it's too big of a hole to fill in the very, very short term. So, I think the TM Series product with that one customer is most of that issue.The XTC-2 is actually being well received into the market. We've won some opportunities. We're being trialed in other places. But it's a relatively long sales cycle, and I anticipate that it'll take a few quarters to start generating meaningful revenue. So I can't backfill – we can't backfill that hole with XTC-2 right away.Whether the XTC-2 is going to see a weakness in the market, which is might you'd (39:08) be asking, it's too early to tell because it's too early in the adoption cycle. I'm still very confident in our overall metro portfolio. I do believe we'd fill that gap with the customer coming back, and I do believe the XTC-2 will be well received into the market. But it'll take another couple of quarters for it to generate any meaningful revenue.Brad, can you answer the question on web-scale?Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerYes. So, Simon, we've said historically that each of our individual verticals are 20% to 25%. The growth in both Internet content providers and the enterprise and wholesale carriers has grown faster than the overall market. And obviously, the wholesale and enterprise carriers carry a lot of that traffic for the ICPs. So those two verticals combined is more like half of our revenues today.Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.And how is that changing over the next one to two years?Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerYeah. I mean I think those guys are going to continue to grow at a very fast clip. We see the ICPs defining the next-generation architectures, they're building very aggressively with cloud, that kind of stuff. So my expectation is they will continue to be a very healthy chunk of the overall revenues.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorYeah, I think it's going to be very healthy. Whether they're going to be growing as a percentage or not, uncertain, because I anticipate we're going to go and be more successful going into metro markets, enterprise markets, those types of things. So I think that they will be an important part. They're going to continue to grow a lot. Whether their percentage grows or not, I actually hope not because I think that we need to grow the rest of our business even more.Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.Great. Thank you for taking my questions.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorYou're welcome, Simon.OperatorThe next question comes from Sanjiv Wadhwani with Stifel. Please go ahead.Sanjiv Wadhwani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.Hey, thanks. Couple of questions. Tom, on the large customer on the Transmode side, what gives you the confidence that it is going to come back? It looks like you're saying it's probably going to come back in the next quarter or two quarters, I guess. Is there a new build over there or something else going on that gives you that visibility?And then one quick question for Brad. In terms of the gross margin strength in Q1, you talked about a mix being sort of different in Q1 that impacted gross margins positively. Can you just give a little more detail on that? Thanks.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorYes. So, why do I have confidence in it coming back? It's been a long-term customer that had a very good relationship previously with Transmode and with us. We've talked to them about their business and why it has slowed down, and there's a specific opportunity that they've won or are close to winning that when that happens their intention is to reinstigate significant purchases with us.Until it's done, it's not done, but I have every belief that what they're telling me is true. I have no reason not to believe it. And then timing becomes a question. Is it a Q2 or a Q3? We're obviously not counting on it being in Q2.Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerSo, Sanjiv, to touch on your gross margin question, it's a combo of things. One, obviously, the deployment services being less, as those are less than corporate average margin, that pushes up the services margin and the overall margins. Also, Q1 being more capacity adds, those capacity adds tend to deliver much higher margin profile for us. And we've said that our margins ongoing will be steady in that 47%, 48% range, but that it could move a point or two either way, based on the mix of the business.Sanjiv Wadhwani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.Got it. That's helpful. Thanks.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorOkay.OperatorNext question is from Doug Clark with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.Douglas Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co.Hi. Thanks for taking my question. It was interesting that you didn't call out cloud or Internet content providers for the second quarter guidance. I'm wondering on your expectations for the second quarter, if indeed you expect that to grow off of a record first quarter. And then similarly and related, are you seeing any change in the competitive dynamic? A few of the large competitors are now a little bit more pronounced in the market, so I'm wondering if that's factoring into purchasing decisions as well.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorWell, I'll take part of it, and then I'll let Brad and Dave answer part. I don't think in our guidance we've ever called out any kind of guidance in the future except here's our revenue, here's our margin, here is our earnings. So we don't do anything around any specific market when we're giving our guidance. So please don't read this as unusual. I believe we're going to have – in regard to ICP market, we sell a lot of different product into that market. We sell DTN-Xs; we sell CXs. I assume you're talking about the CX, and I anticipate another strong quarter on CX. Whether it will be a record quarter, I don't know. But it's going to be a strong quarter on the back of a record quarter, and it's going to be from a couple of new customers that we've just won and haven't been announced yet, and it will be mostly driven by the same people who have driven this growth over the last couple of quarters. So I'm still very positive on the cloud market and our position in that cloud market from a growth of customers and pervasiveness within the customers we've won.Dave, you want to comment at all on new competition we're seeing in that market?David F. Welch - Co-Founder, President & DirectorSure. This is Dave Welch. There are products that are slowly coming online. To address this, for the most part we aren't seeing that as having any major impact on our market share for that. They are comfortable with our deployment processes, our capacities, our densities of our current CX products and they've shown tremendous excitement about our future-generation CX products.Douglas Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co.All right. Thanks for that. And then my follow-up question was on the Infinite Capacity Engine. I know you talked about a timeframe of later this year in terms of product introduction. Can you give us a little bit more specificity in terms of what the timeline for seeing product in market could be?Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorNo, we're going to go and announce – we're going to have Infinera – Insight Infinera in Q3, and we're just going to have to make people wait.Douglas Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co.Got it. Thanks.OperatorThe next question is from Stanley Kovler with Citi Research. Please go ahead.Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)Thanks. I just wanted to ask if we can get some clarification on any FX impact around Transmode as well. And if I think about Transmode sequentially and then into Q2, can you help us understand the operating level of revenue that Transmode is on versus when you bought the company? I was thinking like it's somewhere between $150 million, maybe, and $180 million in revenue that they were on track for – approximately heading into 2016 and how that compares to where you see them now. And I know that you haven't explicitly given your guidance but just curious on that.And then separately, on the product cycles outside of the European customer, can you help us understand how the products from September are tracking versus your prior product cycles with DTN-X and how it compares at this stage of the game along that adoption curve? I have a follow-up. Thank you.Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerOkay. Stan, I'll try to address each of the components you brought up. First, on FX, like any company, the devaluation of the euro over the last year for customers that we have things denominated in euros obviously hurts us. But it's something that we factor into our guidance, that we put hedging in place where we can, and like anyone, like I said, it impacts us but it's not a huge driver in the overall results. But it is a headwind for us.In terms of your question on the Transmode side of things, we're not, as we said before, going to break out that business separately. But I just want to clarify one thing. You said $150 million to $180 million run rate. They were more on a $120 million to $130 million run rate if you looked at last year. And we continue to be happy with what that business is doing. Obviously, as we continue to get cross-sell opportunities, we'll be able to expand that business, and longer-term put our vertically integrated technology into those products.In terms of your question on the product cycles, as Tom mentioned, we've seen good traction on some of the new products, whether it's the Transmode gear, whether it's XTC-2, whether it's XT. Inevitably, though, those things, from a, they're interested, they've given us a design win, to actually significant revenues, it takes time. I wouldn't say it's any different than past cycles per se. I would say it's fairly normal.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorYeah. It's certainly different than when we originally launched the DTN-X because the DTN-X was a step function of capacity improvement replacing basically the DTN, and a vast majority of our customers who had DTN migrated very quickly to DTN-X. So it was a market that we already had a very dominant position in and it was our next generation in that same market.These new platforms are taking us into new markets where we're having to typically replace an incumbent that's not us. So it's going to be slower than certainly the DTN-X ramp, but as Brad said, we're comfortable with the trajectory that we're on. And I think by later this year we should have some – we'll meaningfully know if it's going to impact revenue in a positive way.Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)Thanks. And just to follow up, outside of the European issue, how are we thinking about the seasonality of CapEx for this year? I mean, obviously, it seems like first half of the year is turning up to be a lot weaker than prior years; in terms of seasonal patterns, more back-end loaded. Are you thinking about giving more of a full-year outlook? And besides that, how are the carrier decisions around NFV and SDN and these changing architectures factoring into the push-out of their decisions on new products? Thank you.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorSo I'm going to take part of this first. You've said a couple of times that the European customer we mentioned – you're drawing a conclusion that we mentioned a European customer. We said, a customer, and I would encourage you not to geographically assume.In regard to CapEx spending, like I said, I'm seeing an okay environment in general. I'm not seeing anybody saying we're scared to spend, or our corporate's coming down and saying there'll be no expansions. I'm not seeing people throw caution to the wind and a build-it-and-they-will-come model either. I'm seeing pretty rational behavior in spend, and what I continue to believe is that what's going to continue to drive the expenditure is just raw bandwidth requirements. There is nobody telling me – I mean nobody – that they're not seeing a continued growth in bandwidth.And as long as there's a continued growth in bandwidth I feel very comfortable we're going to continue to grow the business. And that will trump FX issues, it will trump a problem here or a problem there with a customer. And I am as bullish as I've ever been on the bandwidth environment in the medium- and long-term. It is very fundamental, the things that are happening.In regard to NFV and SDN, I think we see more and more requests for SDN and NFV, particularly for us SDN, to be presented to them our solutions. And I think we do a fairly good job of articulating a very cogent strategy and the value proposition of both our SDN solution, but more importantly the underlying hardware of our intelligent optical network.And I think we – this summer you'll see us make some more announcements, and in August you'll hear a whole review of it. And I think, actually, SDN positions us very well to sell more optical gear. I think I've said this before, and I mean it. Our architecture was built to be SDN-ready. It's not because we saw SDN but we saw what an intelligent optical network can do. And I do believe that the more pervasive SDN becomes the more applicable Infinera's architecture is within that.Unlike the router guys or the switch guys, our stuff's not going to be subject to NFV. People aren't going to virtualize what we do. A photon going from A to B takes what we do, and no software's going to replace that. All of these things to me are exciting because it makes the optical layer more strategic. Having a giant pool, an infinite pool of intelligent bandwidth is what enables SDN and NFV to come to life. If you have constrained optical capacity, you can't have a responsive, adaptive network. We have the most unconstrained optical capacity, scale of capacity, because of our PIC design. It pumps me up.OperatorThank you. The next question comes from Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLCHi, guys. Thanks for giving me a question. I've got two, I guess, for you. I wanted to go back to the gross margins because you guys disclosed products and services gross margin at the GAAP level. And both of them moved up pretty healthily in the quarter, and so I just – yeah, I know, Brad, you made that comment about mix affecting the margins. But on an isolated view, are the products and services gross margin you guys are showing us here in Q1, how sustainable are those? And why should – if you're going to tell me they're not sustainable, why should we believe they do back off again? And then I've got a follow-up.Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerYeah. The services side I think are sustainable because obviously, the more the follow-on maintenance services grows and the install base grows, that is obviously very high margin profile. Now, from quarter to quarter it can move around a bit based on how much deployment revenue we have, but over time, I think they will sustain at this level.The product side, as I said before, can move around a point or two from quarter to quarter. And obviously, we wouldn't be talking about an intermediate term of 50 points of gross margin if I didn't think we could do it on a consistent basis. We're just not there yet. We will have quarter where we would hit it, but it's going to take us a little bit more time to sustainably be there quarter-after-quarter. And it's really just largely mix-driven. And it could be reserves in the quarter; it could be warranty cost. There's a lot of things that are involved with margin. They move things around point or two in a quarter.Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLCOkay. And then – yes, thanks for that. And then my follow-up was, Tom, in your opening comments, you talked about this misperception of long-haul. And I think a lot of people see long-haul as either on or off, it's 100 gigabit or it isn't, and of course there were a lot of (54:15) long-haul and the penetration of (54:17) i it's what matters. And I just wonder if you could talk a little bit about – do you know what the penetration rate of 100 gigabit at a (54:26) is in the long-haul networks? You have any idea? I mean, if you could give us any color on that?David F. Welch - Co-Founder, President & DirectorYeah. This is Dave Welch. I think I'm going to break your question into two questions there. The pertinent questions are what fraction of new bandwidth going in the ground is 100 gigabit versus 10 gigabit. And the answer is the majority of long-haul traffic bandwidth going underground right now is 100 gigabit.That is – the second important question is how much is that traffic and continue to grow. And the growth vehicles that drive this are substantial and are multiyear in there. You've got more and more services. Tom mentioned video services, cloud video services, and then you've got 5G migration on top of that. So you've got an underlying pressure where you've got access to the individual via the move into 5G that is going to drive substantial access bandwidths up. And then you have – that hits a data center multiplier on top of that that is going to drive a lot of that traffic out over to long-haul.The old networks had kind of a rough 80%/20% rule. The voice network had an 80%/20% rule where 80% was local and 20% was long-haul. Now that the long-haul has allowed large content of data-center-to-data-center interconnect traffic that no longer holds. And much more of the total bandwidth traffic will be in the long-haul sector as opposed to isolated in a metro access sector.Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLCBut Dave, do you have any idea how many wavelengths out there are 100 gigabit-stage versus other speeds? I mean I would think it's a pretty low number but I'm just curious if you ever seen any quantification of that.David F. Welch - Co-Founder, President & DirectorTotal bandwidth deployed in 100 gigabit is greater than total bandwidth at 10 gigabit right now.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorYeah, that's 80% of the 100 gigabit. It's not the number of waves, but it's 80% of the capacity, I think, is at 100 gigabit today.Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLCOkay. All right. Thanks, guys.David F. Welch - Co-Founder, President & DirectorThanks.OperatorThe next question comes from Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLCHey, guys. I also have two questions. First, for Tom, I was hoping to understand given some of the choppiness you're seeing to what extent there's been any change in your market growth expectations for the year across the different verticals, and to what extent you do expect the business to strengthen or return to normal seasonality as you look out towards the second half of the year?And then for Brad, I was hoping you could help us understand how you're thinking about the need to invest moving forward and to what extent you might continue to invest ahead of sales if the business remains sluggish beyond the June quarter?Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorYeah. So, what we've been clear on is our expectation has been that we will grow faster than the market. That's not very useful because we are really in the long-haul market now, the metro market, and the cloud market. And my anticipation is that we need to grow faster than the market certainly in long-haul and faster than the market certainly in metro. The long-haul market is supposed to grow 7% to 8% for this year and we will certainly stay to our commitment that we're going to go faster than that.The challenge is we've probably grown three times the market rate the last few years. I had no anticipation of growing three times or even double the market rate this year in long-haul because if you look at our market share in long-haul, certainly in North America, we're going to have a hard time growing much faster than the market. We have just too large of a market share. So we have to continue to expand outside the market. So you should assume in the long-haul we anticipate beating the 7% to 8%.In the metro market, it's forecast to grow roughly the 8% to 9% range. We're obviously a relatively new entrants in that with the opportunity to cross-sell a lot of TM-Series platform, which I believe we can go do; and then the introduction of the XTC-2 family. So we should be able to go certainly faster than the metro in that space. The one caveat being it's a lot of new products for us to introduce and that takes a bit of an adoption cycle.In the cloud market – the CX market, that growth is all over the map of what industry analysts expect. And I think we're going to continue to grow rapidly there, but I don't have a good sense for what – really how fast the market will grow. And we're going to be challenged there. If you look at the what is called the pure play, dedicated, purpose built cloud box, we had 100% of the market last year because we basically created the market with the CX. So we're not going to maintain a 100% market share. There will be competitors who have introduced some products – some of them look pretty good – that will win some market share.I do believe that we can grow certainly more than double-digit growth in that market this year without question. The question really becomes, to me, how fast will that market grow. And it's really hard to get an understanding of that. We get better, probably, data from our customers than we get from industry analysts. So I'm anticipating that will continue to grow at a good clip.Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerSo just to address your question on OpEx and investment. We've talked about for a while that 2016 is going to be a year where we need to invest. We are going away from just being a long-haul company that's attacking $5 billion market and now addressing markets that are expected to be $12 billion to $15 billion over the next several years. It's critical that we get out the next-generation technologies.So as I mentioned, we'll stick to the 20% of revenue in R&D to make sure we get the next-generation technologies out. We continue to invest in the sales side of things to make sure we got the right resources to attract the broader markets.That being said, we will look at certain spend to make sure that we're spending on the most important things and put some restrictions. But let me be clear, we will continue to invest.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorWe will continue to invest but, I'll be also clear, we're not going to invest with the expectation of making that increased revenue. We're kind of a pay-as-you-grow kind of company. We'll continue to invest in R&D because I firmly believe in the opportunity ahead of us across the next several years. I believe we have a lot of opportunity to grow our revenue with our current investment in sales. We're going to hire selectively. But I think we will look carefully about expanding G&A and those types of things.Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLCIs it feasible to think that operating margins in the second half to be flat relative to the first half?Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerIt depends. We're not going to go that far out.Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLCThanks, guys.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorOkay. Thanks.OperatorThe next question comes from Tim Savageaux with Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorHello, Tim. How are you?Tim Savageaux - Northland Capital MarketsI'm doing all right. Thanks. Good afternoon. Clarification on the previous discussion about, I guess, the Transmode customer issue with regard to its impact, whether that's commentary about Q1 just reported or Q2 anticipated. And I guess my confusion tends to be some degree from, you had a very, very sharp drop-off in Latin America. And so, I guess, is that – and yet we're still able to put up some pretty good numbers for the quarter. So is there a relationship there? And is that – I guess is that looking backward or looking forward commentary with regard to Transmode customer issue? And then I've got a quick follow-up.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorYeah. It's not a LatAm issue at all from a metro perspective. LatAm – Brad can comment on LatAm in general. We're seeing lot of opportunity in LatAm. I would say it's more seasonality in LatAm than anything else. In regard to the TM customer, whether it's a backward looking or forward-looking, the answer is yes, it's backward-looking for Q1 and it's forward-looking to Q2, so both.Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerSo Tim, it's one of those things where they've slowed down spend. We still think it's a healthy customer and will be a good customer over time. They've just significantly slowed down their spend. We don't think it's a competitive issue. It's just a timing thing.LatAm, Q1 is always going to be a lighter for us both in LatAm and APAC, just because it's a decent amount of it is subsea, which, as I commented on before, to be able to turn on those networks in Q1 tends to be more difficult. And it's a little bit just timing of customer spend. I expect LatAm and APAC to recover for the most part going forward.Tim Savageaux - Northland Capital MarketsOkay. And then just sort of follow up quickly on that, so – and assuming, as I would, that it's a relatively small amount of Transmode's revenues coming in the door for U.S.-based – I know you're trying to grow there. But assuming that's relatively small, you mentioned a pretty strong U.S. number. I think if you make some assumptions, you're talking about 30% type year-over-year growth, and overall kind of mid-teens organic growth for Infinera. As you look at either one of those metrics, U.S. or organic revenue, would you expect those are – it might – are those growth rates for Q1, I think, in the ballpark? And would you expect, I guess, to continue double-digit revenue growth for Infinera on inorganic basis, as would seem to be implied here based on how you can see your trends (01:04:03) on major customer commentary?Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerYes. So, we'll probably not going to get as exact as you would like us to get, Tim, but the growth year-over-year obviously is – Q1 last year we didn't have any Transmode. Transmode's existing business has been steady sans that big customer that Tom talked about, and not a lot of cross-sell synergies yet. So it's mid-teens growth for the Transmode business; it's mid-teens organic. And going forward, we'll see what the mix turns out with as we go forward.Tim Savageaux - Northland Capital MarketsOkay. Thanks guys.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorThank you.OperatorNext question comes from Dmitry Netis with William Blair. Please go ahead.Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLCThank you for squeezing me in, guys. I've got a couple of questions here, very quickly. On the Transmode, sorry to beat a dead horse here. but would I been incorrect also assuming this was historically the largest customer of Transmode that you saw weakness with? I mean can't we...Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorWe're not going to go there (01:05:28)Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerIt was among the biggest. We can't go any more specific than that.David F. Welch - Co-Founder, President & DirectorYes.Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLCAnd you made a specific comment that – I was just trying to see, was this not a European customer? Is it clear that it's not a European customer or (01:05:45)Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorNo, I once pointed out – somebody drew a conclusion that it was European. I didn't say it was European, and I wanted to make sure that other people didn't have me implying then that it was European. I'm just making a comment it was a large customer. So I'm going to leave it at that, Dmitri.Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLCAll right. Fine. Let's move on to a different topic then. The PAM-4 side, Tom, just to kind of get your perspective – I know you spent sometime in the script, and we appreciate that view. But to what extent or what percentage, I guess, of the DCI market do you think this technology can carve out? Have you given that some thought, that short reach PAM-4sof direct-detect technology? And then can you play in that market potentially? I know you – can you do a line cost (01:06:31) maybe or something to that effect? You have a very good partner in Arista that you signed. I mean, how should we think about that?Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorWell, I'm going to break it into a couple of parts, and then I'm going to Dave who's certainly more technologically savvy than I am to answer. I look at the PAM-4 opportunity in the short term as being an interesting architectural and marketing statement that has, I think, zero viable market share this year. So I think that it impacts our market this year zero percent. And I like what Andrew Schmitt has recently – he's the new – Cignal AI Consulting Group he started. And he's pretty astute engineer. And he estimates that the PAM-4 market will be about a $50 million to $100 million market by 2019.So by 2019 most people say that the cloud interconnect market will be a few billion-dollar market and this represents $100 million opportunity in that market. And he says PAM-4 is a short-termed tactical opportunity that will be marginalized as cost and power density of coherent improves. And I would agree with that. If you look at the history of capabilities that are semiconductor-driven, power and size improve over time. And I believe coherent will continue to be demonstrated the right solution. PAM-4 is not a solution today. It's a potential solution for later and the short-term opportunities may be a couple of years.So I think one of the things I like to say is I think it's a flash in the PAM is what I really believe about this technology. Dave, why don't you add some technology to that discussion?David F. Welch - Co-Founder, President & DirectorSure. I think this portion of the market that is successful via PAM-4, as Tom indicated, is something of shorter reach, and that I would tend to characterize that something as certainly on-campus type of architecture. And for an application, that is stuff going outside of the building to minimize the amount of traffic that will be able to be accessed by the PAM-4.So I don't see it displaying a – it will play a complementary architectural role to high-capacity coherent pipes. And further, coherent is going to continue to march down the path for very high-capacity lower-cost and lower power structures going forward.Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLCAnd you guys don't have any intention of playing in that market potentially? As you said, it's potentially maybe just 5% of the total market by 2019.David F. Welch - Co-Founder, President & DirectorSo we don't have any intention in playing and whatever called the pluggable market of which PAM-4 is a participant in.Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLCOkay. Great. And then....can I ask one more? Or....Unknown SpeakerYeah.Unknown SpeakerMake it quick.Unknown SpeakerMake it quick.Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLCVery quickly on the 2.4 terabit, and I think this question may have been asked by actually the first person on the call. But as you introduce the PIC, what was the response of your customers? And would you – or have you seen any posturing? I guess I'm looking at the downside of this, potentially, how customers come back to you saying, we'll wait for that product as opposed to buying the existing 500 gigabit product? Can you talk to that a little bit?David F. Welch - Co-Founder, President & DirectorNo, we're seeing customers continue to buy the bandwidth that they need. They're always looking to bring online as our customer and their applications required; there's no change in that. Remember most of our customers benefit from programs like 10 gigabit in 10 days or 100 gigabit in 10 days. And so the overhang is – minimal overhang of that at this point.They're excited about the operational simplicity that's added by going to deploying 2.4 terabits at a shot, very excited about how it integrates into our flexible optical infrastructure. So that – all things are going well in that front.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorThere's really not a worry in this architecture because our customers can take these new cards with the new PIC and slide them right into a DTN-X chassis. So this is not like they have to say, oh my God, do I have to buy a new chassis? You don't. Your investment-protected for this new technology.OperatorThe next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.Meta A. Marshall - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLCHi, thanks for taking my call. Just a quick question on whether you think that kind of getting the PIC into the TM-Series or into some of the Transmode series is critical to kind of expanding that base or kind of the cross-selling opportunity in your core customers.David F. Welch - Co-Founder, President & DirectorI would say the cross-selling opportunities is really driven by customers that have an Infinera product now, that they like our operating system and they want to be able to roll that out to more and more applications. And for the most part, I'd say almost probably 75% or 80% of our DTN-X customers have an interest in doing that. That's driven by operational simplicity. It's driven by being able to turn services up on Infinera gear from end-to-end and the benefits that come from that. On top of that, the TM-Series becomes that much more stronger as we integrate our PIC technology on to their platform. It gives us a greater density advantages, it give us some interoperability advantages, it gives us some cost structure and power advantages as well. And they look at that, absolutely you see the upside.Meta A. Marshall - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLCOkay. Great. And then just a quick follow-up on with some of your cable customers, I think some of them will change focus to DOCSIS spending later on in the year. And is that something that you will think will change spend on your products and there's kind of accelerating spend now or is it just unrelated kind of the pattern of spending on your products?Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorI think two things. Cable invariably spends most their money in the first half of the year, and we're seeing good spend from cable. So we won't have a good picture for next year's cycle until certainly later this year.But I think as long as bandwidth continues to be a driver, and I don't see anything in the cable space that says bandwidth's not going to continue to be a driver, I'm comfortable that that market is going to continue to be good. And I actually think we have an opportunity to grow overall in the cable space, leveraging the relationships the Transmode is bringing to the table.Meta A. Marshall - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLCGreat. Thank you.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorThanks, Meta. (01:13:53)Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorThank you for joining us this afternoon and for your questions. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress. Have a great day.OperatorThank you. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.")
# 2016 q2
infn.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorWe will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question"
            " comes from Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLCYeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorHi, Rod.Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLCI guess the first thing on our minds is to what extent this reads across to other companies that are exposed to the carrier world and the cable world and data center world that you guys are. I'm hoping maybe you can help us with a little bit more color on how much of this is company-specific? How much of it is customers of yours that just aren't spending or maybe you've lost competitive bids or something like that? And how much of it do you think is related to wider market dynamics that had just rapidly changed here at the end of Q2? And maybe, Tom, if you could...Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorYeah.Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLCCouch your statements regionally so we get some feeling for whether there's a difference between Europe and the U.S.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorYeah. So you're asking, first off, is this Infinera-specific? Or is it broader in the industry? That's one question. I'll give you my answer which might be a little helpful or might not. I think that there's both dynamics at play. I think that we are seeing some of our specific customers that have been either acquired or being acquired. And we're probably overly exposed in that area: current customers that have been acquired, TWC and Cablevision; customers being acquired, XO. Any time that happens in the short term, we've historically seen either pressure from availability of new POs or pricing.I think a couple of our customers, particularly in North America, we have found, put themselves in an inventory position that is bigger than they want. I think that there was a phase they all went through where they were trying very desperately to acquire sufficient capacity for the explosion of demand that they were seeing. And a couple of them are in a position where they have more inventory than they want, that will bleed off. We are not aware of any customers that we are really -certainly not losing or losing market share in. In North America, across the entire long haul space, we have seen in Q2 a significant fall-off in RFQs.Now, one of two dynamics is at play. Either RFQs for long haul are happening and we're not being invited all of a sudden, which I think is not probable. Or there has been a slowdown in some long haul builds for a period of time. And that is my estimation, particularly in the telco space, which we commented to. I believe that has to be a temporary dynamic because none of the demand drivers that are in place, whether it's to move to cloud, whether it's more video, whether it's just increased bandwidth requirements in general, are going away. But I do think that there's a – in North America, a little stall. And I think there's a perspective that it's moving some to IP investment and some to metro investment. Whether that hurts other people or not, I can't answer.I did listen to part of Juniper's call, and they reflected a softening in some telco. And they also talked about significant pricing pressure in Europe. We are absolutely seeing significant pricing pressure in Europe, more than typical, particularly in metro. We're also seeing in the wholesale space in Europe an incredibly demanding and challenging environment for – we've been very successful historically in that space.Some of our customers there I think are trying to figure out what their business is going to be moving forward. And I think that they will figure that out. But right now, I think that there's a slight demand pause from them. We are seeing strength in general in LATAM. And while APAC's not a large portion of our business, we are seeing wins in APAC, a lot around metro, but also some around long haul.So long story short, I think that we are seeing in parts of the market, a demand slowdown that is potentially industry-wide. We are – for long haul, we are seeing pricing compression, particularly in Europe that I do believe is industry-wide. We are seeing submarine for us being industry specific, our Gen 4 technology is critical for us to retake a competitive leadership. That's an Infinera-specific issue and that'll cost us some amount of money certainly in the second half of this year until we get the Gen 4 out.And I think that we also have the complicating factor of we're relatively new to the metro, and we are in the middle of a technology transition to Gen 4, or the Infinite Capacity Engine. We are extraordinarily bullish on what that will do for the company. And I believe that at the end of the day, this is in my mind a bump in the road toward us achieving our objectives. And I'm still extraordinarily bullish about the opportunity of our company.Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLCOkay. That's a very lengthy response. And thanks, Tom, for all that detail. I appreciate it all even more.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorYou asked a complicated question, Rod.Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLCNo, I really do appreciate the color.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorOkay. Thanks, Rod.OperatorOur next question comes from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. Hi, Tom.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorHi, Vijay.Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.Yeah. Hi. So, I just wanted to build upon the prior question here, more in terms of use cases and where the build-outs were, like you could walk us through saying, fine, you saw some demand slowdown towards the end of June. Were there any specific use cases that are architecture related? Like, for example, would the carriers or the customers of yours look to do something else architecturally? Is there an architectural reason kind of motivating this slowdown or is it just a demand pause, spending pause? Thanks.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorNo, it's definitely not any kind of use case application that we're seeing. In fact, the use case of cloud continues to drive – we've been very strong in Internet content. We continue to see lots and lots of demand there. We continue to see long haul demand interconnecting data centers. We've had strength in a number of classic of customers. What we are seeing, like I said, is a couple of customers who've gotten over-inventoried. We're also seeing telco specifically mentioned, as being relatively soft. A submarine for us moving forward is relatively soft.And we're winning in the metro. There's lots of opportunities in the metro. But we are I guess disappointed and surprised a little bit by how long it's taking to turn success in labs into success in field trials into success in creating substantive revenue. I feel comfortable that we're making great progress. But it is taking a lot longer than we had anticipated. And I'm disappointed in the results. But it's not a use case issue. There are lots of use cases out there that are going to require more capacity.Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.Yeah. And then, a quick follow-on – no, thanks, Tom. It's very helpful. A quick follow-on would be how long do you anticipate this funk to last? Would you have visibility saying, for example, will this last through year-end? Or ideally like lead on into early next year? Or is this short term?Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorThat's a good question. And I wish I had a good answer for you. For the same reason we don't give yearly guidance. It's because we have a hard time seeing very far ahead. And this fall-off happened extraordinarily fast. My anticipation, I look at this way, I'm going to assume it takes awhile because I want to make sure we approach this conservatively. But at the same time, I'm not going to believe this is a winter storm that's going to last for a whole season.We're going to continue to invest steadily in R&D because I believe that getting Gen 4 to market is imperative. There's a lot of other things we're bringing to market that I think are imperative. And I fundamentally believe in the demand drivers that are going to drive us opportunistically over the next several years. So, do I think it's a long recovery? I don't. Can I tell you that it's a one quarter phenomenon? I cannot. And we're going to approach it conservatively.Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.Thanks, Tom.Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerYeah. This is – maybe I'll add one comment on there. What we find is that a lot of our customers, larger customers, that are engaged in is the transport of data center interconnectivity over the long haul. Those customers carry a large portion of the data in that application set. The predictability of the base traffic demand in that market sector is sporadic, right? It's a less predictable demand cycle than one that's generated from aggregation networks.This transition here, or it's not transition – this bump in the road, as Tom puts it, is the alignment of that lack of visibility into exactly what those demand cycles are and driving it. The presence – the architectures you were asking about, architectures are still solid and still the same. And our position within these customers is still solid and still the same.Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.Okay. Thank you.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorThanks, Vijay.OperatorOur next question is from George Notter of Jefferies. Please go ahead.George C. Notter - Jefferies LLCHi. Thanks a lot. I guess I was curious. You guys said a lot here. It's a big reduction in expectation certainly for the September quarter. I guess I'm wondering if you can kind of put some of these explanations in a box in terms of how impactful they are. I mean, you talked about subsea. You talked about completion of network builds, inventory, price pressure in Europe, lack of cross-selling. I mean, is there a way to kind of parse out the step-down in expectations according to each of these factors or is it mostly one or another? And then, I guess related, how many customers are we really talking about? Is this 3 customers, 5, 10? How broad based is this?Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerYeah. So, George, I'll take a cut at it and let Dave and Tom add some color. The reality is we're not going to exactly size each of the different things. The metro situation is really just a lack of growth that we had anticipated. So the base business is relatively flat. We're just not seeing the growth that we anticipated both from the traditional Transmode business or the XTC-2 kind of platforms.The large customer spends, right, we have several different customers who have spent a lot of money over the last several years that some are shifting demand to metro and IP. Some guys just haven't laid out their plans for their next build. So, that is a relatively large piece of the challenge. Subsea, we've had a fair amount of success over the past several years. We continue to see a lot of opportunities. We're just not winning at the rate we did before. Subsea is not a huge market, but it is a big challenge for us as we don't continue to win the follow-ons, right?And then, just in general, telco demand given the size of some of our customers, some of our Tier 1 customers, when those guys pause spend, it does put a hurt on us.George C. Notter - Jefferies LLCGot it. And then, again, are we talking about 5, 10, 3 customers? What's the magnitude of this?Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerYeah. So, we've said in the past, one or two guys pauses someone can backfill it. This is multiple customers and multiple verticals. So, it's unfortunately the bad alignment of several customers.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorYeah. Across different verticals, George.Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerYeah.George C. Notter - Jefferies LLCGot it. Okay. All right. Thank you.Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerThanks, George.OperatorOur next question is from Alex Henderson of Needham. Please go ahead.Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLCHey, guys.Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerHey, Alex.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorHey, Alex.Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLCSo, a couple of related questions here. I mean, obviously, some of this is a function of you guys shifting to metro and still having to fight your way into that marketplace as the long haul slows. Do you think the shift in spending priorities may have caused some hesitancy in the long haul as they shift their spending priority into the metro? Or do you think that this is more a function of M&A activity? How would you weight those two factors? And how big a factor is the transition in technology if you were to weight that? I mean, if you were to take those three pieces, how would you parse the pressure here?Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorIt's hard to be – for sure, Alex, but yeah. I think certainly, the transition in technologies I think is mostly constrained to the subsea area today. That is where fiber capacity is highly prized, and there's no trade-off for it. And I think that that's certainly an Infinera-specific issue. I think across the larger customers that have slowed some spend, some of it is absolutely moving to metro builds. Not all of them, but some of them.And there's been clarity in the industry that over the last few years, the long haul market has grown faster than most people anticipated. And metro has grown slower than most people anticipated. And I think that there's some shift to that right now. There's been a relatively hefty upgrade cycle to 100-gig in the long haul. There's been a relatively hefty investment in capacity expansion in preparation for needing to bring more capacity into the metros.And I think some of that spend is now happening in the metros. That will not say – that does not say that capacity in the long haul is sufficient today, as new architectures within cloud, as 5G starts being prepared for long haul capacity. I just saw a report that says bandwidth in the long haul is supposed to grow somewhere in the 30% to 40% per year for the next five years. I believe that at least. So, I think that there's going to be significant bandwidth growth continuing in the long haul. But in any one quarter or short period of time there'll be priorities of metro over long haul, and probably balancing out what would be historically an over-investment in long haul historically.I do see some potential for the acquisitions to be causing some slowdown. But I think that's, like I said, temporary in nature. And I do think the competitive environment for metro is truly unbelievable. It is extremely competitive. And I think that's partly a dynamic that the metro market continues to be over-served. And I think that that's going to continue to fix itself over the next couple of years. And there's going to end up being fewer competitors in metro. And we are going to be one of them. So, I think that Gen 4 will help us in the metro, bring a significantly differentiated platform to the market.And in the mean time, we're going to have to go fight it out and probably adjust our margin expectations of what we can earn in the metro. When you look at some of our competitors in the metro space, they're growing relatively quickly. But they're doing it at the expense of margin. Margins have been crushed, and it's almost inverse economies of scale; the more I sell, the less I make. And that's a hard concept for me and us to wrap our heads around. But we're going to have to go look at that until we can get our Gen 4 platform out.Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLCSo, just to be clear, you've got a number of M&A events happening to your customer base. What portion of your customer shortfall was related to customers that were within that set?Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorIt's not huge.Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerYeah. I mean, it's not huge, Alex, but if you think about it, some of this is pricing pressure, right? So when a customer doubles in size or roughly doubles in size, they're going to come back and try to pay for part of that acquisition through getting price reductions. So, that impacts us. The other piece is just uncertainty, right? We've got customers that are being acquired that have to go check with the head office before they can spend. So, it's not huge, but it is meaningful.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorThat's meaningful...Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLCIs it 25% of the gap in the third quarter number or is it less than that?Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerYeah, we're not going to size it exactly, Alex. But it is an impact. It's not the biggest impact though.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorI think it's important, Alex, Brad mentioned like four or five different things that are confluencing together. It's a combination of all of them that makes this such a big drop and quite frankly, happening so quickly.Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLCAll right. See you at the (40:42), thanks.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Genovese from MKM Partners. Please go ahead.Michael E. Genovese - MKM Partners LLCHey. Thanks a lot. So, I heard basically from you guys here that long haul is slowing down, that metro is taking time competitively, specifically for you guys. And then, Cloud Xpress is doing very well. And I'm not surprised by any of those things, although I am surprised by the magnitude of the guide. But I think the most important thing to get to here is for the metro, I know you've been asked this, two or three times already. But further clarification is great.But on the metro, how much of it is actually delayed spending versus these long sales cycles, your product upgrades, you coming to the market later than some of the other competitors versus – so, again, how much of it is company-specific and how much do you actually believe the metro market is slowing? And what would be the reasons that you could figure out for why the metro market would be slowing, if it is?David F. Welch - Co-Founder, President & DirectorYeah. So, I'll try and answer that. Overall, the metro market isn't slowing. To introduce a new product into the metro platform in a number of the key areas that we are seeing strength in is out in the access end of the spectrum. They don't go and massively deploy access in all of their metro simultaneously. They go do it out in a step-function. They prove it out within a particular size network. And once they prove it out, then they make it available to all their additional metros. And it takes a period of time.So, an actual ramp-up in the access network may take a couple of years to perform it. The value of it is substantial. Our visibility and opportunity for metro deals coming in, in Q2 was substantially higher than Q1 in that. So, we are seeing a lot more opportunities. And we were advancing those opportunities at a very good clip. But the timing it takes for that to realize into real revenue, especially on the access side of the network, takes time. And there's nothing you can do for those because it's just – it's too many sites, right? The number of locations on how these things get deployed is much greater than in a long haul network. And that's just – that's the nature of an access side.And the core side of the metro application, which is really an extension off of our long haul system – well, that is a higher dollar per site opportunity than an access portion of the network. And those things are starting to convert. And those are mostly Infinera classic customers adding on our metro portfolio on to their networks. Those are going well. The opportunities are going.Pricing pressure is definitely a reality in the metro, especially as 16QAM-type of technologies impact the metro, which is not a dynamic in the long haul. And those transitions, those wins are coming. We talked about Telia. I think we've made announcements. You've got a couple of other wins in that category. But it takes time for them to prove it out and test it in their lab and turn it into revenue.Michael E. Genovese - MKM Partners LLCGreat. Good answer. Thank you. And just for my follow-up, maybe for Brad. If we get a 300 or 350 basis point sequential decline in gross margin, is the biggest factor there volume? Or is it mix? Is it competitive pricing? I mean, what are the two biggest features there?Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerYeah. I mean, the biggest one, Mike, is actually volume-driven because it's the absorption of fixed costs, right? So, we've got an infrastructure, whether it's in sales, support, new process introduction, this kind of stuff, that is fairly studied and built based on a much higher revenue base. So, because we believe in the opportunity – in the longer term opportunity, we're not going to cut that back in one quarter, so it has more of a drag on the margins. So, that's the biggest thing. There is some amount on pricing pressure and some of the investments, but the fixed cost absorption is the bigger piece.Michael E. Genovese - MKM Partners LLCGreat. All right. Well, good luck guys. I hope the visibility improves sooner rather than later.Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerWe do, too, Mike.OperatorOur next question comes from Dmitry Netis from William Blair. Please go ahead.Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLCOkay. Thank you very much. I'm going to probably ask seventh question on the call about this. But again, kind of as you look at the softness or pockets of weakness in telco, submarine, metro, some of the standout performers clearly are DCI and ICP. So, can we – well, what are you guys baking in into maybe Q3 and maybe Q4 as you look into the second half of the year for those two verticals? Is that – I know Dave said there's sporadic demand from those two. But do you have enough in the pipeline to continue to see that perform kind of to your expectations? And can you describe maybe competitively what are you seeing out there from the competitors that are coming in with the new products out there as well?Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorSure. So, obviously, we are baking into our guide what we see happening. And we see still healthy opportunities for data center capacity in general, and the wholesalers that carry that traffic. But we are seeing increased competition for the first time really in this quarter, both from the Infi (46:40) solution, as has been talked about a little bit, though we think that's fairly contained. And we're also seeing entrance in to the market that we're now competing with for purpose-built solutions that are more in the model of a CX. We still think we have a substantive lead from an experience set.We've been now selling to and listening to customers, and putting in features that they value. We believe without question with our Gen 4 road map that it continues to remain the technology leader as other people are just now entering the market. But we do see entrants it the market that appear real for the first time. We still have healthy CX expectations for the quarter, though we are not anticipating that growth like we've had over the last couple of quarters. Last couple of quarters have been quite outstanding.Part of it is new competition. Part of it is spend cycles from a certain – from certain of our customers that are in an off-spend cycle because of either fiscal year's budgets or project planning. But we do anticipate certainly a healthy demand, very healthy demand, over the long term, and even in the short term continued expansion into that market space. Not only with our traditional customers, but we're also continuing to win new customers with that CX platform.Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLCOkay. Very helpful. And as a follow-up, can I ask a two-part question? Number one is it kind of follows up to the previous question on DCI opportunity in this Infinite Capacity Engine. Is there any timing to when the platform will be available? Or was it something you're going to disclose at the Analyst Day or Investor Day you're planning at the end of August? Just kind of give us a sense when that will be ready to go and commercially available.And then, the second part to the question is kind of as you kind of go into Europe, I want to zoom in a little bit on Europe and maybe ask you to kind of describe what you're seeing out there as far as the competitors driving this pricing pressure. Is it the Alcatel-Lucent's now being part of Nokia that are being really aggressive? Is it the U.S. competitor group, kind of guys like Cisco maybe? Is it the Chinese potentially that are playing there that's driving the price down? Any color on that front would be really helpful, too.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorYeah. I'll answer that one first. Our view in Europe is pricing is being probably driven down by Coriant and Alcatel. And we're also seeing in certain applications Huawei in their new DCI space be even more competitive than I'm used to seeing as they enter in a new market. I mean, virtually or literally giving applications away, particularly around the DCI space. But I do think it's a couple people leading and a lot of people following along because the market price is being set, quite frankly, very competitively by a couple of price leaders.In regard to when we will talk about our products based upon the Infinite Capacity Engine, our anticipation is that at inside Infinera, we will tell people what our specific plans are for introduction of that technology into platforms.Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLCGreat. Thank you very much.David F. Welch - Co-Founder, President & DirectorThanks.OperatorOur next question comes from Tim Savageaux from Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead.Tim Savageaux - Northland Securities, Inc.Hi. Good afternoon. And I wanted to follow up briefly on some of the vertical questions. And if I heard you right, the cloud business may not grow at the same rate in the second half and may see some declines. But that's been a bright spot. And I imagine, given the pricing commentary in metro, it seemed what we had was a customer issue with Transmode last quarter that's kind of been maybe added to, to some degree, by market issues. But – and so, confirm if that's the right way to look at it.But even with some more conservative assumptions there, and let's just assuming you're able to stay flat in Q4, you're looking at something on the order of a 15% or so decline in long haul for the year. Trying to reconcile that relative to your overall market growth rate commentary, I think it was 6% to 8%, maybe half of that's China. I don't know if that's half the growth rate or how you meant that. But are we looking at a situation where we're kind of under-growing the market by that wide of a margin, understanding some of that's maybe subsea and temporary? But if you can just sort of comment on that kind of direction of thinking and that sort of whether that growth rate or rate of decline for long haul is (51:56).Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorI'll start by answering some of your cloud commentary. And I think that what you've articulated is kind of how we view Q3 in regard to cloud. In regard to the commentary on metro, with a customer – historic Transmode customer last quarter, it was actually I think a Q1 dynamic. And the good news, quite frankly, is, as Brad had said earlier, the metro – our business has not actually declined. It's, you can call it, nominally flat to a little bit up. We've been able to backfill that business successfully. The challenge is growing it substantively with new wins that roll out for revenue. As Dave said, there's a fairly long gestation cycle between a win and then materially impacting revenue.That gestation cycle is longer than I had anticipated. We are creating wins. And as Dave said, looking at our RFQ from Q2, I believe it was a record for us on the number of metro RFQs that we received. So, there's lots of activity. We're making lots of progress. The gestation cycle is just significantly longer than we thought. And it's compounded by prices compressing extraordinarily fast. And we've been playing unfortunately a little catch a falling knife game. And it has not been as successful as – in hindsight, we should have been more aggressive sooner.In regard to long haul market share, in Q1, the industry analysts said we gained market share in Q1. It's hard to understand right now what's happening in the dynamics of the long haul space. As we said, in Q2, there were very, very few RFQs that we received. If we're not receiving, we're anticipating other people aren't receiving them also. We do believe the long haul is all real-time numbers, right? The long haul space outside of China will probably grow 2% to 3% this year.Are we going to grow market share or lose market share? Too early to call. But I think there's a reasonable chance we'll grow market share in long haul this year. It just won't be 3x the market growth that we've shown the last couple of years. So, we've grown market share. We've grown three times the growth in long haul the last three years. We knew that at some point that would meter out. It just has metered out a lot faster than we thought. And I believe that we will stay neutral to grow market share because I don't know of long haul deals we're losing. We're just not seeing that. So, that's my kind of read of the situation, Tim.Tim Savageaux - Northland Securities, Inc.Okay. And as a quick follow-up, is there any kind of indication of maybe some legacy technologies falling off, I mean, to the extent 10-gig is still any type of meaningful part of the equation here?David F. Welch - Co-Founder, President & DirectorNo – I don't – the – from a technology cycle point of view, the only place which you talked about earlier is in subsea.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorYeah.David F. Welch - Co-Founder, President & DirectorAnd we'll be out of that one pretty shortly. Don't see any issues in and around other technology cycles.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorWell, our 10-gig business in long haul is very, very small. So, that's not the issue.David F. Welch - Co-Founder, President & DirectorActually – yes.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorYeah.OperatorOur next question comes from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.Meta A. Marshall - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLCHey. Thanks for taking my call. A couple of questions. You mentioned making some investments in customers as a reason for the gross margin pressure. And I just wanted to get a sense of whether those were existing customers that are kind of expansion projects. Or were those new customers that you were looking to get into and just a sense of the categories they fall into? And then, the second question was just Transmode kind of customer issues seem to be related to a particular customer kind of waiting to see whether they were going to win additional, a bid to provide capacity for ICPs. And I just wanted to get a sense of whether that decision had been made away from them and that was part of the reason for the pause or unrelated. Thank you.David F. Welch - Co-Founder, President & DirectorOkay. So, Meta, in terms of the investments we're making, it's a combination of both new and existing customers. So, we have some existing customers that we are growing share with that are great longer-term customers that when the Infinite Capacity Engine comes out, we want to make sure we have more and more of their footprint. It will take some investment upfront, though, to go expand that business. It is something we've done in the past and has been very successful for us.We also have some newer customers that we're getting opportunities with that are going to take us some investment to get in the door with. Now, these are all opportunities that are great longer-term margin profiles. They're potentially very large opportunities. We're not going and taking dumb deals that will never be profitable. It's just a matter of making that investment upfront, make sure that we are in with that customer, then we can maximize the benefit of the Infinite Capacity Engine when it comes out.Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerAnd this plays on one of our strengths. As a leader in gross margin in the industry and to be able to make those investments and sustain a guide of 47% plus, minus, that's an incredible position to be in to be able to make those investments for our upside.David F. Welch - Co-Founder, President & DirectorYeah. And, Meta, to address your Transmode question, we had highlighted a customer last quarter, those – although the customer is still there, the volume hasn't increased with that customer.Meta A. Marshall - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLCGot it. Thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Stanley Kovler of Citi Research. Please go ahead.Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask if we can get back to looking at just specifically the long haul and if I back out what – I guess what I think would be next quarter's service revenue and if we get, back out some metro. Is it fair to say that your long haul business is kind of back to 2013 levels on a quarterly basis and we can kind of plot a path back over time? Is that the trajectory we should be thinking about? And the other side of the question would be specific to metro and perhaps even on subsea, can you help us understand the features or the feature sets that are maybe stalling the opportunities for you here, especially in metro? I mean, what are some of the things that you need to get from a product standpoint besides Infinite Capacity Engine to get the 100-gig (59:24)? Thank you.Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerI'll address the first part and then let David address the metro question. From a long haul perspective, we're definitely not down to the 2013 levels. We've grown that business very significantly with our DTN-X technology over the last several years. To Tom's point, it's just not growing at the 20%, 25% we did over the last years. And so, there is some challenges with that business. But we are still a significantly bigger business than we were back then in long haul. And we have a tremendous opportunity with the Infinite Capacity Engine to get that on another significant growth trajectory.David F. Welch - Co-Founder, President & DirectorYeah, one of the things that I would encourage you to not go back to 2013 when we were rolling out a brand-new platform in the DTN-X. The difference this time is that if it's just a technology issue, which, like I said, I don't think it is, but our customers can go now with our Infinite Capacity Engine in the chassis, they already have, the chassis they already deployed, and with an in-service upgrade to this new line card that carries more than twice the capacity. It's a much easier upgrade cycle.We've already won that customer. They already have the Infinera infrastructure ready to be upgraded versus putting in a whole new infrastructure. So, I think it's a substantively more straightforward decision for them to make and a substantively easier win for us to have. But I still go back. And for most of the long haul state, I don't believe most of our challenge today is a technology transition. It is the fact that we are not seeing quotes for long haul, and I don't think that that's an Infinera-specific issue.Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerYeah. So, let me try and address your feature question. To be clear, our metro trying to create the mode – or seeding the momentum in the metro is not a feature problem. What we've tried to explain is that in the nature of an access-oriented metro product line, where – which is where we're differentiated the most, it takes time to be able to deploy those out because of a number of access nodes that you have to have in order to generate the same amount of revenue for that. The overall opportunities are big and great, but it is a – it takes more time to invest in it. There's no feature shortage. A matter of fact, in most – in things like Mobile Fronthaul, we're feature-preferred in these technologies, so that, no shortcoming in metro features as far as slowing us down.On the subsea, the feature that we do refer to there, which is the only place that I see any type of feature shortness, and it is a short-term issue, and that's all about fiber capacity. If I'm deploying new capacity on a fiber over the next quarter, Infinera's product line has slightly less capacity than the alternatives out there. That is solved by our Gen 4 engine and actually becomes an advantage, slight incremental advantage to us when we get our Gen 4 engine out. And that, we'll be through that transition here pretty quickly from that.If I can add on a couple of statements on the long-haul trajectory, this is – to Tom's point, this is not a product transition issue. This is a – our customers carry a large portion of the long haul data center interconnect. Their growth, averaged over the course of the year, is very high. We continue to be the supplier for those customers, no loss of market share. However, their deployment of that bandwidth has taken a pause and their spending style. And then, those pauses between various customers unfortunately happen to line up this quarter, right? But no loss of market share, no loss in that our customers are still deploying substantial amounts of capacity for that application, and hence why we believe that this is a pause and not a reset to our business.Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)Thanks, Brad.OperatorOur next question comes from Jeff Kvaal from Nomura. Please go ahead.Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.Yes. Thanks very much. I guess two questions, and one is what – when you were talking to your customers about them wrapping up their footprint plans, what were they telling you about what they would be buying after they finished a given product or project? And I'm a little surprised that they would yank the rug out from under you so quickly, given that they were finishing a project that might have been something that you could have had a conversation about.Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerYeah. So...Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.Okay. Go ahead. Sorry.Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerYeah. So, Jeff, the reality is even though we're close with our customers, a lot of our customers aren't very forthcoming with exactly what they're planning to do. And especially in some of our bigger verticals, it's even more challenged. They don't tell anything – anyone anything about their business. And so, that's the challenge we have is they don't always lay out exactly what they're planning to do. In certain cases, they've talked about it. But timing is not certain on when they're going to do that.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorIt varies by customer. Some of our customers were very clear to us that when they were done with this long haul build, they were going to move some of their spend to the metro. Other customers have implied or talked about that when they finish this build, they will start planning on an overbuild, a next-generation new one. A lot of those have now moved out in time to a degree from a couple to several quarters. That's the surprising part to me. Usually, when we see our customers finishing builds, there's a number of customers who start new builds at the same time.So, the fact that some of our customers were telling us that they were finishing their builds, that we knew they were finishing their builds, the surprising part has been the lack of new builds that are filling that hole. That is a unique situation over the last several years that we're not familiar with. So, as Brad said, some people won't talk about it. Some people did give us plans that are moving. Some people did what they said, which was moving spend priority over to the metro. It's all a combination.David F. Welch - Co-Founder, President & DirectorYeah, I think that there's a – in the old history of telecom, where the aggregation networks, the data for those aggregation networks are driven by human-to-human interactions, you're able to spread that over out a sea of large numbers. Now, a lot of the bandwidth is consumed by machine-to-machine communications. In that environment, build infrastructure, absorb it; build infrastructure, absorb it, is much of a stronger tendency, plus the people that are doing that and trying to come up with projections of bandwidth, they don't have 1,000 people working in there to go do their planning. They have a handful of people to go do their planning. And that makes for a different dynamic than the way the telecom business was a decade ago.Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.Okay, thank you for that. My second question then comes to OpEx. And that is to what extent would you consider further squeezing your operating expenses if revenues don't come back over one or two or three quarters?Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerYes. So, Jeff, we'll continue to watch that quarter-to-quarter. What we don't want to do is cut our spend that cuts our opportunity in the future. We will be very mindful of what we do spend. As I think you've seen, we've taken significant actions already. But we'll play it as we go. But we will continue to invest in the future because that is what – is the opportunity we believe in.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorYeah, I'll be a little bit more emphatic. We've been I think very prudent in how we've adjusted our expenditures. We've stopped hiring. We are addressing any type of discretionary spending. But I mean it. I've never been compelled that we have a huge opportunity in front of us. I think Gen 4 is a monumental capability that the industry will absorb.And we are going to continue on track of bringing Gen 4 to market across various platforms as soon as we possibly can. We are also going to continue to invest in next-generation technologies, like Gen 5, so that we never end up with a technology gap again because it's too difficult to gain market share and then lose your position because of a six months' or a one-year gap. We're going to bring our cadence of bringing that technology to market. We're going to continue to improve it to being less than it is today.Having said that, we are being prudent on what are the new things we're starting. We're not going to start some things that we would like to start. But we recognize that we are in a fiscally challenged position and I prize very much creation of cash and not losing money. So, we're going to try to balance that. I don't believe this is a long-term protracted downturn. If it turns out to be such, we will react in a different fashion. But that's not what I plan at this point.David F. Welch - Co-Founder, President & DirectorThanks, Jeff.Thomas J. Fallon - Chief Executive Officer & DirectorThanks. As always, thank you to our customers and partners for their ongoing commitment to Infinera, and thanks to our employees around the world. With that, we'll see you – talk to you next quarter. Bye-bye.Brad D. Feller - Chief Financial OfficerThank you.OperatorThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.")
# 2016 q3
infn.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorOur first question is from Vijay Bhagavath at Deutsche Bank.Vijay"
            " Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.Yes, thanks. Hi Tom, Brad.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.Hi, Vijay.Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.Yeah, hi. My question is, at a bigger picture level which is you have been given these growth rate assumptions for DCI, Metro, long haul, optical in the past, has anything hinged in your planning assumptions, Tom, on DCI, Metro, long haul looking forward? Would be good to get kind of the before/after on your growth rate assumptions and then also any updated assumptions on the competition. Has competition meaningfully increased or stayed about the same in DCI, Metro, long haul? Thanks.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.Yeah, so in the DCI space, the analysts' forecasts are continuing to be approximately, I think, 60% a year for quite a while, and we see that probably being realistic. As we said in Q3, our DCI business was down off a couple of record quarters. We're seeing very strong Q4 demand and we see a very strong pipeline of opportunities into next year, particularly for our new CX2 platform. I think that that's going to spur a lot of opportunity both with classic data center interconnect people, but also other people who are looking for immense capacity in a very straightforward, simple box.So I'm pretty comfortable with analysts' expectations in the DCI space and I believe that we have every opportunity. I don't think we're going to preserve our 94% market share, but I think we're going to continue to be the market leader in that.We are seeing some, I would say the beginnings of real competition in that space. People have introduced products, oh gosh, probably 18 months ago now, and for the most part, they haven't been real. There are starting to be inroads. We're seeing a few people winning some deals internationally, probably more than domestically, but some in domestic too. I think that that's normal. I think some people will want a multi-vendor solution, and while we have seen some competitors win, I have not seen them win in what I would consider our largest DCI space yet. And I think that as long as we bring out our CX2, that's a market, one that I feel comfortable we're going to have a very good presence in.In the long haul space, I do think the market has slowed and I only have a microcosm of it. But I can certainly speak to our customers, they've slowed. But also the industry analysts' reports say that long haul, outside of China, has also slowed down. I do think it'll grow this year, probably in the 2% to 4% range is what I think analysts are saying. I think we will clearly not do that well in long haul this year and I think that my expectation is that the long haul will continue to grow in the mid-single digit range over the next several years. I don't see any abatement of fundamental demand, of fundamental traffic. Quarter perturbations, and I do believe that we are being hit in Q4 by CapEx limitations by some of our biggest customers. That doesn't alter the fact that they need more capacity. And so far, we continue to be their provider of infrastructure and I'm anticipating next year that that recovers.I believe that when we get our next-generation platform out, that will help us tremendously. One of the challenges we have right now, our Gen 3 product is excellent product, our customers are very happy with it, but it's very difficult right now for us to win new customers with our current Gen 3 technology. To really be aggressive, to really be compelling for a new customer, we need to get our next generation out and that will help us grow our long haul share. I think we'll start retaking market share.So that's kind of my view of the world, Vijay.Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.Yeah. Perfect. It's very helpful. A quick follow-up on is what gets the business back to a recovery mode? Is it one of your top long haul customers purchasing new capacity? Is it some new design win in Metro? I want to understand what's the trigger or the catalyst to get the business back to recovery mode? Thanks.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.So I'll make some comments and I'll ask Dave to answer. I think there's a couple of things. One, it's not any one thing. One of the reasons that I think we continue to be more susceptible to volatility is we continue to be too much in North America. So we need to continue to expand our presence outside of North America, not by shrinking North America, but by growing our presence elsewhere. I think we're actually making good progress in that arena. We're making progress in Latin America. We've done reasonably well in Europe. Our market share actually is staying firm in Europe. In Asia we're actually growing a lot of opportunities that we see.So I think one is to diversify more geographically. Two, we need to continue to be less of a long-haul provider. We've become more diversified than we were certainly a few years ago, but we need to continue to lead and grow and push this DCI interconnect. I think we have every opportunity with our next-gen products to absolutely take a significant portion of that market growth. We need to get our Gen 4 product out so that we can have a re-competitive position in subsea. Subsea is – it doesn't drive most of the business, but it's a portion of the business that we need to have.So we need to get our Gen 4 technology, our next-generation technology into the market. We need to have 16QAM into the metro and other places. So all those things we are doing, it's not going to be one customer that drives that. We need to go bring this technology to market in all spaces, Metro, long haul, DCI, and we need to capitalize I think our complete differentiation around our overall technology portfolio.We've done this before. Unfortunately we are somewhere between two quarters and four quarters late on this next-generation technology of what we should have done. Mistake on my part a few years ago. We are going to have that technology across our portfolio next year, and I think that we have a great opportunity. Dave?David F. Welch - Infinera Corp.Yeah. I'll just add on a couple of comments to reiterate what Tom had there. One is we expect as the new year starts on that some of these issues around CapEx that we are seeing at tail-end of this year start opening back up. Two, the Gen 4 technology will start moving out to customers here very shortly. And Insight Infinera will lay out our multi-platform approach for that technology and get into more details on how that impacts both the data center, the metro, the long haul and the subsea marketplaces. And I think as that capability, all indications, if I use the DCI as our first market assessment from that and the demand that we're seeing from the DCI 4 or Gen 4 technology, I expect to be very successful across our platforms with that technology as we roll that out over the beginning of 2017.OperatorThe next question is from Alex Henderson at Needham.Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLCThanks. Couple of questions if I could. There were a number of things that you said you needed to get cleaned up in order to get these new products launched. One was the integration of the Metro operating system into a single – you know truly unified operating environment, a single pain of glass, which I think you were talking about having done around year-end. Is that on track?Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.Well, there's a difference of – I think Alex, there's a difference of operating system versus network management. So I don't believe I ever said we'd have a single operating system by the end of this year. What I talked about was a more tightly coupled network management. Our future roadmap has a single operating system, but that was never a this-year discussion.Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLCThe question I think was as you described it, network management.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.Yes.Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLCFrom the service provider's perspective, not having to mess with two management systems. Is that on track?David F. Welch - Infinera Corp.Yes. You know if we break it down into management, control plan and data plan, what we have right now is, a management plan is from a customers' perspective sees a unified management plan across our platforms. It will be out – has been coming out, but will be finalized in this quarter.The data plan connectivity between the platforms is also – is part of our Q4 release; so I am happy with that. Control plans, actually the deploying the circuits, that's not fully integrated. That's really where we get into the integration of the operating systems. The embedded operating systems, that will happen over a longer period of time. But from a management plan, data plan, connectivity, will all be there, right?We also talked about, and we launched, I want to say in August, our Xceed platform. That Xceed platform will be a vehicle that we tie all of our product offerings together in order to be able to both manage and control that. So that capability is going to be expanding. And they're using that, so you indicated, Tom indicated, even though we just introduced it towards the end of last Q3, we're getting good acceptance from our customer base out there and we have a couple of deployments going on already.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.Yeah. One of our first deployments will actually be across a TM and DTN-X customer base. So, we're hoping we'll have a good opportunity to validate that to the market, you know the people that Xceed provides a real value of helping to deliver an end-to-end solution.David F. Welch - Infinera Corp.Yeah.Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLCThe second piece of that puzzle was the DSP. Obviously you guys have been running much longer cycles than some of the other players that seems to have gotten you behind the curve on that. And if I understand correctly, you're in the process of turning a new version of the DSP which would then enable FlexCoherent to next-gen Metro products to be ramped up with the Infinite Capacity Engine. When you look at the DSP investments you're making, one, is there a step-up over the next three or four quarters to accelerate that process and impacting R&D? And two, is that a longer-term change in your R&D profile that will require you to spend more on R&D in order to invest, instead of a 4-year cycle, maybe an 18-month cycle, i.e., adding $20 million to $30 million to your DSP development costs on an annual basis? Is that the right way to think about that?David F. Welch - Infinera Corp.No. Right question. Let me – all right, Gen 4 comes with our new DSP engine and so that's in operational. We expect to start shipping that to customers pretty quickly. Insight Infinera, we'll get into more detail about the multiplatform rollout of what that technology is. Very happy with that. It does everything that we had hoped it to do as far as managing the reach capabilities across the system.What's key in the DSP architecture is make sure you've got DSP architecture that allows end-to-end connectivity across our platforms where appropriate, and I feel comfortable that we will achieve that across our platforms and be able to have meshed, optically-meshed networks that will take advantage of that.Going forward, we will up the pace of our DSP. We are confident with our ability to do that within our current R&D profiles. Don't expect any major spikes in our R&D in doing that, but we expect to get onto a – you know maybe a – whatever, substantially more rapid deployment process of our DSP engines and it comes coupled with kind of – you got to understand the detail of how we do our engineering to see that base comes out, but net-net the optical engine advantages and differentiators that we brought to the market for the last 11 years is now going to happen on a much more frequent basis.OperatorThe next question is from George Notter at Jefferies.George C. Notter - Jefferies LLCHi there. Thanks a lot, guys. I guess job one in the self-help program here is to get that 2.4 terabit shipping in the DTN-X and I understand you kind of want to have folks to wait to the Analyst Day to, I guess, disclose more details there, but I guess I just want some comfort to know that that's relatively soon after the delivery of the Cloud Xpress 2 with that same chip. Is that fair to say?David F. Welch - Infinera Corp.Yes. There's a sequence of products, the first product to come out will be the CX2. And then we'll come out with our complements to our XT and our DTN-X chassis platforms in a relatively rapid sequence for that. The hard part of this, of all the development or a good chunk of it wraps up into making sure your optical engine does what it's supposed to do. And that's the same engineering needed across all platforms. So once we release one, it looks a lot alike for the rest of the platforms. And so we expect to be able to bring these out pretty quickly. And we'll get into more detail.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.Hey, George, you're asking the question is if it comes out, the CX2 is the first thing and then the DTN-X is the next thing. We've got a number of things that are going to roll out at Insight Infinera that make that too simple of a view. So I do encourage you to wait until Insight Infinera, but we've got a whole product portfolio that we will talk about, that includes the Infinite Capacity Engine.George C. Notter - Jefferies LLCGot it.David F. Welch - Infinera Corp.And George, I made a comment in my prepared remarks about the Gen 4 PICs moving into production. So that should give you some tickler as to – that those are on track and moving forward as we would imagine.George C. Notter - Jefferies LLCGot it. Okay. And then I also wanted to ask about the gross margin profile for the next, I guess, set of quarters. We're talking low- to mid-40s now, and it seems like that's obviously a good-sized step-down relative to what you guys were thinking, say, three months ago. I guess I want to make sure I understand what's driving the new view? I guess I presume that some of this is about forward pricing the current products to be more aggressive in this kind of gap period before you deliver the new stuff, but maybe you could kind of confirm if that's right or not right? And then just talk more broadly about why the change in estimates?Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.Yeah. So, George, I think the analyst community thought it was higher, but I was trying to be very clear in the past that our margins would be in the low- to mid-40s. Obviously we're at the low end of that in Q4. But you've got it right in terms of what we're doing is, in a lot of cases forward pricing the Gen 4 products based on current technology, we are being more aggressive on deals to win new footprint with existing customers and also new customers.We're also leaning more into the instant bandwidth side of things which is – are all great things for us to do for the longer-term margin of the company, it's just an investment period for right now that hurts us.OperatorThe next question is from Doug Clark at Goldman Sachs.Doug Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co.Hi. Thanks for taking my question. My first one is a follow-up on that. And as part of your fourth quarter gross margin guidance, you said that line card fill would be down and presumably some of that's correlated to just the CapEx spends of your customers, but why is line card fill not more of an offset to some of the more aggressive pricing on some legacy products in the interim?Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.Yeah. So, Doug, I chose my words fairly carefully. I said we didn't have visibility to it. And you're right that the CapEx challenges at customers is not going to help the situation. Conceptually, there should be a fill that still happens, but when a lot of our big customers come and say, I'm out of money for the year, and we tend to have a lot of the year-end money be in line-card ads, instant bandwidth licenses. I just don't see that happening this quarter because of those CapEx challenges.Doug Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co.Okay. That makes sense. And on the services side, it looked like there was actually a nice lift in at least GAAP gross margins for services. Can you talk a little bit about what's going on there?Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.Yeah. Unfortunately it's just less deployments, right? So as you have less – as you know our services has two main components to it, the deployment side of things and the ongoing maintenance activities. The ongoing maintenance activities continue to be strong, but as the mix shifts away from deployments, it has the impact of improving those margins.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.Doug, one of the things that we've been clear on historically is that as we put out more footprint and as we do more instant bandwidth, that means more footprint. That's a good thing for a company even if it has short-term margin in it. Usually we have in the last several quarters had a balance with that with some fill that we've had either from other installed networks or instant bandwidth. I think right now you're see us be willing to be aggressive for deals that over a reasonable period of time are exceptionally good for Infinera, but upfront we have to take a margin hit.I still believe that that is the best thing for our company to do. Get our installed infrastructure out there and create an ability to install both instant bandwidth licenses and FRU (36:54) in the future. I think that this short-term lack of FRU (37:01) visibility, I think it is because of a CapEx limitation. I believe it has to go away.The next way, the best most inefficient capital use for expanding capacity if you have an Infinera network is to buy a FRU (37:12) from us and I don't believe that there's any reduction of bandwidth requirements and we're not losing footprints. So I'm a big believer that this is an investment toward a better future.OperatorNext question is from Meta Marshall at Morgan Stanley.Meta A. Marshall - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLCGreat. Thanks, guys. I wanted to dig into the Europe market. You know you had clearly mentioned that that was an area where you hoped to get more aggressive, but last quarter you talked about the competitive environment there being particularly aggressive. So just wanted to kind of get an update on that.And then, second, one of your competitors has had or seemingly had kind of good success in Europe with some of the web scale customers, highlighting their depth of portfolio, is that a fair view and something you think you can get back kind of as your Gen 4 product comes out? Or just how do you think about the web scale market in Europe as well? Thanks.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.So, in general, I continue to see a lot of price competition in Europe. There is a wholesale space where we're very strong. There's overcapacity from a perspective of number of people serving that market, and the wholesale pricing is being collapsed. That puts a tremendous pressure back on the equipment providers which we're seeing. We are doing reasonably well in our traditional business there from the long haul perspective. We've actually held market share in Metro that we're not growing market share there. Our business grew as fast as the market did over the last year, that's not good, it's not bad. I think when we get our next generation optical engine out, that will help us.In the web-scale, I think I know who you're referring to. I think that where we have a distinct advantage is when it's very, very large scale deployments for high capacity. That's where our CX platform does extremely well. I think as more and more North America providers move their architectures and data centers into Europe, we actually have a number of European deployments, these are with North America providers, our ICPs that have European data centers there, we actually do very well there. I do think we have an ability to extend our success into smaller-scale ICPs there and we need to, quite frankly, get more aggressive with that when we have our new platform out. So that's where I think there's opportunity.I've also, I think if you've witnessed, if I am talking about the same competitor that you are, they have experience as incredible margin collapse as they've grown their top line. I will say we responded probably not as fast as we should have at being more aggressive on pricing and we are fixing that.Meta A. Marshall - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLCGot it. Thank you, guys.Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.Thanks.OperatorThe next question is from Ashwin Kesireddy at JPMorgan.Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLCYeah. Hi. It's Rod Hall for Ashwin.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.Hi, Rod.Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLCI've got a couple of questions, I guess. I wanted to ask you about, I know you're going to go through detailed product phasing on 17, and so I don't want to get into that, but I do want to ask when you start shipping product GA are we looking at normal testing delays, like field test delays at your customers? Or is there any way that you could see that accelerating so people deploy a little bit quicker and maybe you recognize revenue (40:40) a little bit quicker? So that's the first question and I had a follow up to that.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.Yeah. So I think on the CX2, I anticipate a faster testing cycle. The CX family is a fairly straightforward. It's not trivial, but it's a point-to-point network and it is with the same basic software operating system that the CX1 family has. So I believe that we'll be able to deploy and not go through inordinate amounts for revenue recognition.Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLCOkay. That's good news. And the other thing I wanted to ask you is on the gross margins, I think Brad called out this one-off warranty impact this current quarter, were underlying gross margins significantly lower due to one-offs or one-off help that you got? Or are they – can you help us understand what organic gross margins were this quarter, so we can kind of get a feel for what the deterioration looks like?Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.Yeah. So the warranty item I laid out, Rod, was a contributor, it wasn't the biggest contributor. The biggest contributor was just the mix of our business across different customers and that kind of stuff. Warranty just as our quality continues to get better, that has a positive impact on our overall reserves. Those are one-time type of items, right, so we would have been closer to guidance, but still above guidance even without the warranty side of things.Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLCOkay. So just maybe a 1 percentage point or something like that or less impact and then we just move to a significantly lower gross margin, because of the revenue compression next quarter and mix?Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.Yeah and there were some investment deals that we bid on and won, that were kind of right on the cusp of Q3 and Q4. Those didn't get deployed in the quarter, so that gives us some mix benefit there as well.Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLCBrad, just on this gross margin point, it seems to me like the narrative kind of changed as we moved through the quarter. You guys started off thinking maybe you could be closer to mid-40s even as you aggressively bid and I think it's more and more a situation like this, there's a lot of complexity and as you work through it you learn more. Do you feel like you've got your arms around where that – the worst case gross margin at this stage? Or do you feel like there's more to learn as you participate in these deals, bid and so on (43:06) beginning of next year?Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.Yeah. So, Rod, the biggest variability is the timing of those deployments and how successful we are with the more aggressive pricing strategy. It's been fairly successful so far. The piece that's harder to figure out is exactly the timing of some of those deployments. Tom mentioned the year end and I did as well, the year-end CapEx challenges, some of those pushed into Q4 and now are pushing into Q1, potentially because of those CapEx issues. So it's just hard to tell the timing of it, but as I mentioned before, these are not investments to just go chase low-margin business, these are investments where we are taking lower gross margin now. As they grow and as they deploy with Gen 4, they will be significantly better margins, even better than we've done historically.So it is really just a timing thing and we're having the confidence in the future that we're okay to take the lower margins now. Do I think they go down into the 30's and this kind of stuff? I don't. But I think in this range, you're going to see for a couple of quarters until we really start to deploy Gen 4.Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLCOkay. Great. Thanks, guys.OperatorOur next question is from Dmitry Netis at William Blair.Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLCThank you very much for taking my question. I'll ask a simple one on the Gen 4 first. I think you guys said Q1, can we expect that in January, March, February, month? Any more quality on that would be good.David F. Welch - Infinera Corp.Are you placing a purchase order? What's the...Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLCLet's assume I am.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.How many do you want, Dmitry?David F. Welch - Infinera Corp.Yeah, how many do you want? We'll move you up in line.Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLCAll right. I'll take that as a January then?Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.We're getting it out as fast as we can, Dmitry. You know, quite frankly...Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLCOkay.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp....our goal is to have it in early customer testing sometime late this quarter, that's our goal. Our goal will be to start shipping it as early in the quarter as possible. I wouldn't necessarily count on January.Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLCOkay. And as far as the mix of new customers versus existing, how's that looking? I think you did say there was a mix of both. Are you seeing like overwhelming majority of new customers shipping, taking up orders on CX2, because of the capacity improvements, because of the new modulation scheme, et cetera?David F. Welch - Infinera Corp.Yeah, I would put it at, we're going to be in a, I'll say, a little bit of a constrained scenario as we first start shipping it. Our current customers are the ones that are asking for the highest demand and we'll make sure to satisfy that and mix in new customers along the way. But first things are going to go out to the guys that can deploy it the fastest.Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.Yeah, the comment around the new customers, Dmitry, is with the specification of the CX2, there's a lot of customers that either didn't deploy the first generation of CX or haven't been customers in the company, they are very interested in that portfolio.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.I think Dave's right. A number of our current customers, actually all the large ones, are very interested in the CX2. And those are people who will be able to take it the fastest and deploy it the fastest. But it is opening up a number of significant opportunities where we have not participated, either as a company or with the CX1, and I believe that's one of the things I'm very excited about. They probably won't be the first customers, because they will have to do more testing. But I think there's an opportunity with the CX2 to vastly broaden the number of customers that we have in that platform.Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLCUnderstood. Can I also ask you about the kind of the follow-up on the CapEx challenges you're seeing. And there are a couple of comments you made which make you sort of believe or make me believe that there may have been isolated to Infinera, but then there's also broader kind of industry comment as far as the kind of money not being there at the end of the year. And I was just wondering if you could kind of break it into certain customer base of – or customer segment, whether it's a cable, telco, web-scale, is it specific to Infinera customer base? Is it M&A related? Anything you can...Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.Yeah. So yeah, the reason I highlighted it, because I've been doing this a long time. This is the first time I've come, seen in a quarter that I'm getting consistent messages from a number of sales people and talking to the customers that they have – I guess they have hit their CapEx limit. And I think that with the last few years what's happened is people have overspent their CapEx early in the year and they've come back to the corporation and asked for more based upon the ability to deploy services and they've been getting that. And my personal belief is that a few customers that are important to us went through that scenario again this year, and the corporation did not give them relief from their CapEx.We're seeing it from Tier 1s internationally. We're seeing it from wholesale, both domestic and international. And we're seeing it from at least one cable, which is outside the acquisition. Acquisitions always delay things. So we have that continuing to be a little bit of a burden to us. But this one was not related to acquisitions. So we're seeing it in multiple segments. We only are exposed, obviously, to their transport spend. So I don't know if they're potentially saying your transport CapEx is capped and we're spending it somewhere else, but I have got it consistently that budgets are frozen. It's not everywhere. But we don't have enough huge customers that if a few of them go – it happens, it's impactful. And that's what we're seeing.Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLCOkay. Just to follow-up on that, you said the transport versus something else. You do have a metro product on the Transmode side of things, so I suppose you are seeing all the RFPs that are coming in on the metro side of things as well, right? So can you just say.And by the way, as we are discussing Transmode, maybe kind of going back and sort of looking at that acquisition, where the run rate of that business was when you acquired it and where it is today, I know you had seen some challenges. Have you recovered from those challenges? Have things sort of stabilized on that front? And you had big expectations here in North America for Transmode, whether that's sort of falling behind the expectations or running sort of in line? Just curious on that front as well.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.Yeah. So in regard to CapEx, at least one metro customer articulated the CapEx issue and pushed out all of our deliveries from Q4 into next year. Most of it I'm referencing is in regard to classic long haul product, but one specifically was for metro. In regard to how we're doing in the metro, as I said in the call, I'm certainly disappointed in comparison to what my expectations were. I think in Europe, like I said, we're holding market share. We're growing in Europe about like we – like the market is growing. That's candidly disappointing, we didn't buy the company to hold market share.In North America, from a number's perspective, I'm disappointed with the results at a revenue level. Having said that, we are winning some accounts and have initial deployments with what I would consider classic Infinera customers. Some of these customers have substantive opportunity and I think it will grow. It's been slower than I ever thought it would be. We're also using it as an opportunity to continue to work on getting a couple of other of our long haul customers. They started out by saying a number of them, we don't need another metro provider, but now we're at point of looking at potential applications. So I'd say year of work to go from, we don't need one to, hey, maybe there's something we can use. I'm going to not give up. We're just not going to give up on that.I continue to see some progress in Latin America with the metro product. We continue to grow Latin America both for long haul and with our metro offering and I think that that's good. I think once we get our next generation of optical capability into the TM Series, it will be a much more compelling capability. It's very hard right now to introduce a platform that doesn't have some of the features that we need in our next-gen optical capability. That's not that far away. We're working very hard to sell it. I'm disappointed to-date, but I would not say that we haven't made progress in introducing it to important customers with some adoption. The adoption has been slower than I hoped, but we are long-term – we got a long term in this game and I think it will set a foundation for being successful in the metro.OperatorThe next question comes from Patrick Newton at Stifel.Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.Hey, Tom, Dave and Brad, thank you for taking my questions. I guess first two clarifications, Brad. One, I missed what 4Q revenue guidance was. And then, two, you stated the Cloud Xpress business was down sequentially, but I missed by how much?Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.Yeah. So the Q4 revenue guidance is $175 million plus or minus $10 million. On the CX side, we said it was down sequentially, but we didn't quantify it.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.We said it was down sequentially off two record quarters and then we said we'd see a very good pipeline of Q4 into next year.Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.So we can assume that there's a return to growth in Cloud Xpress beginning in 4Q?Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.Yeah. I mean I would say more it's in line with the first half when we're seeing very nice growth and then a bit of acceleration as well.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.I think that the growth is going to come with the CX2. I think it's going to drive significant volume and dollar growth with the CX2.Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.Okay. Great. And then, Tom, clearly DCI is a great near-term opportunity, but you seem pretty bullish on second half of 2017 in Metro, and you cited several reasons. But can you elaborate a little bit on what's driving the confidence in cross-selling capabilities, given they've really missed expectations to date. And then how should be think about the Metro footprint that's available for Infinera, given that several operators have already announced who they are using, and using competing vendors. So can you – does your opportunity rest with those operators or winners (53:25) have not yet announced 100G Metro upgrades?Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.Well, we continue to sell the TM Series to all the operators who have already told us they have Metro strategies and some of those we're being successful in. I think that there is always opportunities if you have a good customer relationship and a good reputation to insert and create opportunity.When you go to Insight Infinera, if you are, you will see a roadmap of what we're doing, and I think that our new capabilities will help us stimulate demand in the Metro space moving forward. I think that a number of the seeds we're planting now will create opportunities. Seeds – some of the early deals we won now will create opportunities for growth in the second half of next year in particular as these start to expand into other Metros. There is nothing that says that other than the new platform we're going to go and win a lot of Metro business. I just see the traction we're making, I see the number of customers we're winning. I think that the new optical engine coming out, all is positive for us.David F. Welch - Infinera Corp.And I'll add a couple of quick comments on there. First thing, when you win a Metro, we mentioned a couple we win, the time from first revenue to the time to large revenue, it takes a few quarters because there are so many nodes that you have to go address and the planning (54:49) goes around that. So usually they give you the first routes within the Metro, might not be a lot of dollars associated with it, but it is just the tip of the iceberg because of the amount of properties that they would have. That's the first thing on why it takes time from win to significant revenue.The other aspect that people need to consider, and we've talked about it before is the different applications within Metro space. We were engaged in a significant number of what I'll call edge activities, mostly in the Mobile Fronthaul and Backhaul type of activity. On a global basis, we've talked about a number of Fronthaul, Backhaul wins that we've had I think as early as Q2. In that timeframe, we are engaged in a significant number of opportunities there, and we'll see whether they come to fruition or not.Those are big opportunities, but they are the same type of thing that they don't happen in a month. They are you win and you create momentum across a very large set of footprints. We're very excited about those being, progressing our way to various stages of those bids and we're hopeful that we'll land some of them. And that leads us to believe the mid-year, later in the year, frankly on the scale of those types of deployments, it's not very far away. And that's just the nature of the large number of edge activities.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Jeff Kvaal at Nomura.Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.Yes, gentlemen. Thank you very much for taking the question. I'd like to begin by sort of following on your comments about the fourth quarter spending pattern being a little unusual in your history in the market. Mine too, mine too. The other thing that was unusual was that carriers typically don't spend more money in the first quarter than they have in first, this, the budgeting process, takes a while. So how much confidence do you have that the spigots will turn back on in sufficient time in the first quarter that you'll get a decent run rate and that it might actually be a bit of a positive sequential quarter for you? The bigger picture question that we're all trying to ask here is, hey, what does the bottom look like, and when is it, and when might things start getting better?Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.Yes. So let me address your seasonality question first, Jeff. You know the reality is Q1 typically for us tends to be a significantly down quarter based on exactly what you mentioned which is budgets got to get approved, they get ramped up. I think the different dynamic this year is when customers have real demands and real traffic, real customer needs, that tends to go faster. Now, given where we're looking in Q4, I'm very cautious about what Q1 looks like. So time will tell there.The other thing to keep in mind about Q1 or to understand about Q1 is Q1 and Q2 for us tend to be historically very strong with our cable customers. We've had some M&A activity there. The buying pattern of some of our customers, I think will change to be more even throughout the year versus very front-end loaded in Q1 and Q2. That could have some impact on our Q1 as well.Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.Okay. So the message is don't go crazy thinking about a recovery in the March quarter, I guess, is the message?Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.Yes, I would be a bit cautious.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.We just don't know.Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.Okay, and then my second question is where are your CX and CX2 products are – when you are winning there, or where you expect to win, what types of products are you displacing? Are they your own, are they your competitors', or is it possibly is it just an incremental build that you wouldn't have seen before?David F. Welch - Infinera Corp.The Gen 3 networks that are deployed out there for the most part are going to continue to consume Gen 3 product. The new routes that come online and overlays and overbuilds or new customers come online, they're all going to be Gen 4 product. New subsidy opportunities are going to be all Gen 4 product. Data center overbuilds, it's going to be, give me the best bandwidth engine that you've got, and I'll buy that until you get the next best engine that you've got. So they're going to rapidly adopt – I expect them to rapidly adopt and transition to Gen 4 technology quickly. The benefit is, they're buying more and more bigger chunks of bandwidth in that process as they make that transition.Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.Yeah, and the other color I would add is you asked what are we displacing, we've largely created this small form factor market and it's grown very nicely for us, but there's still a fair amount of DCI spend that's happening with more traditional metro gear. And so you can see the players in metro, our expectation is more and more of the true DCI market will move to the small form factor portion which is where the CX and CX2 were targeted.David F. Welch - Infinera Corp.And I'm going to add onto that, the kind of the inverse of that is, and Tom mentioned it in his script, we are seeing applications to take a DCI-like box, a little profile, something that's very different in character than the pluggable chassis type of configuration that a metro might have had, and they are starting to put those into normal metro (01:01:06) networks as well, where they find the simplicity of the commonality, the simplicity of deploying those within their networks, has a real operational advantage for them.OperatorThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Fallon for closing remarks.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.Thank you for joining us this afternoon for your questions. We look forward to speaking with you again at Insight Infinera. Have a great day.OperatorThe conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.")
# 2016 q4
infn.append("Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And"
            " our first question comes from George Notter with Jefferies. Please go ahead.George C. Notter - Jefferies LLCHi, guys. Thanks very much. I guess I just wanted to kind of circle back and make sure I'm really clear on the timing of some of these new product deliveries and when you expect them to subsequently generate revenue. Would you mind just kind of going down the roster here, CX2, the meshponder products, the MTC-6 and so on? Thanks.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.Yeah. Sure. It's pretty much the same as we've said at Insight Infinera, George. We'll have revenue for the CX2, which is the first product coming out in Q2. As we said there, there was an outside stretch, we'd try to get it in Q1, but I think we should plan on revenue in Q2. The 3300 will ship in Q2 and we believe we'll see some revenue in Q2, but most of it probably hitting in Q3. The goal, obviously, is to ship. And right now, we're on track for shipping in Q2 for revenue. How it's recognized is probably more dicey.We said at the Insight Infinera that the DTN-X upgrade and the 3600 are still on track for the second half of this year. We're not giving any more granularity at this point than that. And our upgrade to the TM-Series will be coming out this summer, and we're on track for that. In regard to the MTC, correct me if I'm wrong, Dave, that's already shipping.David F. Welch - Infinera Corp.MTC is, yes.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.Yeah.George C. Notter - Jefferies LLCOkay. Great. That's helpful. And then, I guess if I just step back and sort of think about when you guys might start to see the improvement in top line, Brad, I heard your commentary about sequential growth over the course of the year. Is that driven by new product deliveries or is that driven more by some of the customer situations fixing themselves on the M&A front? What's the bigger picture on top-line growth? Thanks.Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.Yeah. George, it's primarily the new products, but obviously, Q1 is a seasonally down quarter. So, Q2 tends to be up. I think it will be up more with the release of some of the new products.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.We've consistently said that kind of revenue recovery to previous growth will be probably a second half of this year, and I'm staying kind of with that view. I do think that as we get through this Q1, which is always a little bit dicey in our industry, that will help. But we are also – as you pointed out, George, our customer base is being consolidated at a fairly voracious rate, looking at it. About 40% of our revenue is currently in the process of being merged or acquired. Certainly, different sizes of that, but that's a substantive amount of our revenue.I don't believe in any situation, except maybe one, we end up in a bad spot. I think we end up in a good spot, probably with stronger customers. But I think that during this process, whether you're preparing to go through the merger or acquisition or have just done it, there's a period of slowdown of spending. I think you guys have probably seen some of the press releases rightly and commenting on that, and I think we've already been experiencing that. This is not new for us. I don't expect a step function down from here. I think we have started experiencing it in Q3 of last year. When 40% of your business is being consolidated, there is no chance that that does anything, but slow down decision-making.George C. Notter - Jefferies LLCThank you.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.Yeah. Thanks, George.OperatorOur next questioner today is Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. Hi, Tom, Brad.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.Hi, Vijay.Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.Yeah. Hi. So, while you guide one quarter at a time, that's fine, it would be very helpful to hear from you, Tom, and also Brad, any qualitative color you can give. What are your customers telling you, what are your sales teams telling you, as we head into the back half? Any particular product and market that you think would re-accelerate or pick up momentum heading into the back half? That really helps our modeling view for the full year. Thanks.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.I think, as I made in my commentary about clear pent-up demand for ICE4, there is clear pent-up demand for ICE4. We've got customers excited about it. We've got our sales guys excited about it. I think that there's substantive opportunity there. And they're all encouraging us to get that to market as soon as possible. I think that I see strong opportunity, as I made in my commentary, for subsea. There's a lot of subsea network being built right now that I think ICE4 will do well in. There's tremendous amount still of data center activity, and I think we are well positioned with that. As we made in the commentary, it's a more competitive environment than it was a couple of years ago. But I think the CX2 will be in a league by itself, so we have to get that to market. And I think our new meshponders are going to be extraordinarily well received. I also think that our approach to open with a flex-grid capability presents tremendous opportunity, certainly in the second half of the year, but also over a number of years.So, I think that the second half, there's nothing that I believe indicates that it's not going to have a strong and a lot of opportunity. We talk about some of the metrics that I talked about last quarter, when we look at the number of RFQs, both the quantity across our products and the dollar size, all that's been on a positive trajectory, and a lot of it's reflected in our new products. So, the data supporting my belief is being validated by what I consider transactional flow of paper. Dave, you want to make a comment?David F. Welch - Infinera Corp.No. We spend a number of – I think our products are well suited for us to go back into taking-a-market-share mode that we're used to for last number of years. I think the bandwidth demand is growing rapidly. It's growing extremely high in some of our markets. But in all markets it's going up. Our competitive levels are dramatically improving as we bring out the product in the first half of the year. So, I expect to go back into taking-a-market-share mode.Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.Perfect. Quick follow on would be on product gross margins, what would cause that to uptick? Would it be primarily product mix or any cost efficiencies downstream? Thanks.Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.Yeah, obviously, the cost structure of the ICE4 products is much better than the current generation. So, that will allow us to have a cost advantage as we go forward. Mix across different products always impacts us. But the thing that will – two things that will start to drive it back up, Vijay, is the cost structure of the new products and, obviously, having higher volumes going to the fab gives us leverage on that side of things.Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.Thanks.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.Thanks, Vijay.OperatorNext questioner is Stan Kovler with Citi Research. Please go ahead.Stanley Kovler - Citi Investment Research (U.S.)Thanks for taking my question. A couple of things I wanted to address, one on the market front. Can you help us understand your comments about the long-haul and metro and wholesale markets? Is that the same that you talked about back in November, there have been any changes? It sounded like the market sizes were a little bit – market growth was a little bit light?And then beyond that, from a customer standpoint, obviously, the transition with a lot of customers going through mergers, can you help us walk through the phase that we're in with some of these customers? And what is the process that you have to go through to restart at the customer? But not only that, when you go through the merger, if let's say the entity was a Tier 1 or a Tier 2 that you may or may not have business with, how long do those decisions take for you to then either be with – selling to the entire entity versus the existing target customer that you have? Thanks a lot.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.Yeah. So, the first question you talked about market growth. The long-haul market slowed down last year after a number of years of probably 8%, 9% growth year-over-year. The long-haul market that was viewed as probably low-single-digit growth, we anticipate that to start to come back this year a little bit. That was some of the pressure that was put on us last year since we've been vastly a long-haul supplier. I do think that long-haul over a number of years is going to represent a very good growth opportunity. But as people have finite CapEx, they probably spent disproportionately on long-haul for the last few years and now they're moving that, some cases to IP, some cases to metro, some cases to data center. So long-haul has been under pressure. I anticipate it will start growing again this year, probably low to single – or mid-single digit, and that should help us, in general. Certainly, as we get ICE4 out, we can bring to market a more cost-effective solution, good margin, but more cost-effective and that should probably help.In metro, surprisingly enough, metro was supposed to grow a great deal last year outside of China. That was muted, anywhere from low-single digit to flat year-over-year in metro. I do anticipate that metro has to continue to invest. There are too many applications that are going to require more and more capacity in the metros, all the way through the metro from access through aggregation and actually that positions us well for when we enter the market with our upgraded TM-Series platform. We anticipate this year metro will start in the mid-single digit, maybe up to 8% – 5% to 8%.Data center continues to absolutely explode, I think anywhere from 60% to 100% expected growth in that market. So, our opportunity needs to be – to maintain as much of the market share as we possibly can. I think in the last published data set on purpose-built data center, we were at about 90% market share. The probability of us maintaining 90% market share is low. But in a market that's growing 60% to 100% a year, we can have a very, very healthy business. I don't want to give away any market share, but I think it's practical. Our new CX2, I do believe, is a platform that is in a class by itself. So, I'm optimistic about that.From a customer consolidation perspective, we have some customers that I can't mention by name that are being acquired, a couple in the cable space. I think in all those cases, we're going to end up in an okay spot. And I think that there is going to be some different business practices. One of the customers historically bought almost all their year spend in the first – almost the first quarter. And the new company is saying we're not going to do that. We're going to have a more linear approach to it. That puts a little pressure on our Q1, but I'm anticipating that that comes back in the later parts of the year, so that's actually good news to me.I think that in every regard, we are going to be able to, except one, preserve our position in long-haul, and so far we have had receptivity by these new companies to expanding into the metro with them. And I'm excited about that opportunity. I think when people are being approached to acquire or acquiring somebody, there is very little appetite for introducing new vendors into new spaces, because there is too many uncertainties. With a lot of those certainties now behind them, they're more interested in looking at architectural approaches for the future. And I think it does give us a door open into new opportunities.The one area that we can comment on, Verizon just completed its acquisition of XO. We have a substantive footprint with XO. The business with XO has been reasonably good. That dance with Verizon is still to be had with us. I mean, we're certainly engaging with them and I think there will be opportunity, but I'm certainly not forecasting anything at this point until we get further down that pipeline.The big one, obviously, out there is Level 3 and CenturyLink, both of our largest – two of our largest customers. That acquisition isn't targeted to close until Q3. So, my belief is, for the most part, for at least a little bit of time, things have to be roughly run as our two independent companies. We still see a consistent demand from both of them. But like I said earlier, when people are going through large-scale integration, typically things slow down. You're not in an invest phase of network because you don't want to ignore what network assets you're picking up. I anticipate we'll get a better picture from that over the next couple of quarters as things get closer to the end. But I anticipate in the short term, both of them have to run independently. That's a long answer. Sorry about that.Stanley Kovler - Citi Investment Research (U.S.)I appreciate the detail, actually. And then, if I just have one quick follow-up on product gross margin, for Brad. Can you parse through the elements of gross margin relative to the prior quarter from a volume perspective and from a mix perspective? So, obviously, inventory is relatively static and revenues still below $200 million. How much did, specifically, that fab volume impact your gross margin? And does that piece come back in the second half, so gross margin should be in the 45-plus-percent range? Thanks a lot.Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.Yeah, the loading in the fab and that kind of stuff, the impact is pretty consistent quarter-to-quarter. The bigger impact in Q4 and Q1, quite frankly, is the mix of deals were bringing the revenue. Including, obviously, as we talked about before, some investment deals to make sure that we are exceptionally well set up for when the gen-four products come out. So you're thinking about it right, though, that both things, as I mentioned earlier, will contribute to market share – or gross margin expansion over the year, filling up the fab and the cost structure of the new products.Stanley Kovler - Citi Investment Research (U.S.)Thank you.Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.Thanks.OperatorOur next questioner today is Dmitry Netis with William Blair. Please go ahead.Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLCOkay. Thank you very much, guys, and good job executing on the plan. One quick follow-up from the prior question on the gross margin. Are you implying, basically, the next two quarters in that 41.8% rate, 40% in Q1 is what you're guiding to gross margin, so is that your trough quarter basically in Q1? Number one. Number two, as far as the cash burn goes, I think you saw about $15 million of cash burn in terms of free cash flow in this current quarter. Is that a trough quarter or Q1 will be a trough? Can you comment on that? That would be good.Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.Yeah. So, I don't like the word trough. But as I mentioned, I think, the margins will stay in the region where they are now. Like I said, it will start to pick up once the new products come out. So, I think that low 40s type of level is what you should expect for the next couple of quarters. From a cash burn perspective, obviously, still in a very healthy cash position with $360 million in cash. But given the guidance we just talked about, we will burn a decent amount of cash this quarter, probably similar to Q4.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.Dmitry, on the margin, it's hard. Never say never on it's the lowest, first of all, because you never know what's going to happen in life. But we kind of think this is where the bottom would be. Having said that, last year, as I made in my commentary, 100 gig ASPs dropped in the market – was it 27% or 29%?Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.29%.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.29%, that's fairly unprecedented. And it's not like there's a new technology that's hitting the market that causes that drop. There is a substantive amount of pricing pressure that's occurring. I do think it starts mitigating, but I think that there is a level of certain competitors who are willing to buy market share whether they can make money at it or not. That can't last forever, but I do anticipate pretty good pricing pressure.The good news in my mind is when we get ICE4 out, I think we are structurally better prepared for that than anybody else. And I think that we have an opportunity based upon selling ICE4 going back to our margin expansion by the end of the year. But I do want to caveat it. When the market is in this type of transition with ASPs dropping that dramatically, it's hard to predict.Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLCOkay. Thank you, Tom. I appreciate it. Now, to my real question, if you will, want to talk a little bit on the CX and – CX, CX2, kind of your DCI product set. First of all, kind of I'm doing the math, and just correct me if my math is off, but you should be – given the comment you said – you made as far as the doubling or more than doubling of that business over the course of the year, you should end up somewhere in the $80 million, $90 million range, which would put you right in the 10% mark. So, I just want to double check that's correct, and you're forecasting for growth in that business clearly through the 2017 timeframe.Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.Yes.Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLCAnd as you speak to that, can you talk to any of the ICPs? I think you had two out of the top four in the prior generation. Has any new ICP come in as a result or are you expecting any new ones as you kind of roll out the CX2? Maybe PTC meetings had helped you secure the visibility of that. So, I'd love to hear your thoughts on that front.Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.So Dmitry, your math is roughly correct on the fiscal 2016 levels. I'll let Tom comment on the opportunity with the other ICPs for CX2.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.Yeah. So, we are still very engaged with a couple of the good solid ICPs that we've talked about before. We've expanded – there is a new tier of ICP – data center guys that are not traditionally considered part of the top five that we've expanded into and they're building substantive data center interconnectivity. We've done a good job of attaching there. And based upon the CX2, I firmly believe that we'll be able to add a significant new ICP this year based on the CX2. We have to still earn it, but we've been given the nod for they will do the testing. And that's – the hardest milestone for us historically is getting them to agree that they will do the testing, because they'll only do the testing and sign a contract if they have a business driver and they believe it's a viable solution for them. We have achieved that. So, now, it's down to delivering the CX2.Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLCGreat. Can I ask one quick one on EMEA? You rebounded there 30%. You mentioned some traction with CX business there. But I presume there was also telco-related traction there, maybe not. But can you dissect that market and tell us exactly what went on this quarter, why it was so strong? And was there much of the Transmode product that's sort of rebounding here was this core Infinera business?Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.Yes. So, Dmitry, it's a combo of different things. One is we started to see the ICPs who have been doing a lot of their CX builds in North America to start to build out more in Europe. The traditional metro business did really well, and the stable base of telcos there as well was originally strong. So, it was pretty broad based. I'd say the thing that's probably a little bit better than it's been in the past is just starting to see the ICPs deploy CX in Europe.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.Yeah. I would say that the ICP is deploying the CX, but also the TM-Series has done extremely well in the second half of last year, particularly with our traditional customers there. It's been a reinvigorated buying cycle by those guys. And that's really great to see. In general, as we commented on the call, telco has been weaker for us and I think other people in the industry over the last six months.OperatorOur next questioner today is Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.Thank you for taking my question. First, on this ICP market vertical, could you give us a sense of what percent of the fourth quarter sales were coming from that group as you define it and how that compared sequentially and year-over-year as a percent of sales?Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.Yeah. So, Simon, in Q4, it was in the range of where it's been historically. We talked about in Q3, just some slower spending from those guys in our Q3. So sequentially, it was up quite a bit, but the level it's at for Q4 is similar to the level it's been historically as a percentage of revenues.Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.And if my recollection is correct, we can call that kind of 25%ish, is that right?Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.It's in that ballpark.Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.Okay. And then in terms of your full-year 2016, can you give us a little bit of color on 10% customers? Presumably, you'll disclose that detail in the 10-K, but if we could get that now. And this I think is important given our sense that 2015 was – your 10% customers were folks that are consolidating. And if we're trying to figure out how to model the impact of the consolidation, I'd like to get an understanding of the concentration in 2016, if we could get that detail?Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.Sure. So, we talked about the large North American bandwidth wholesaler being consistently throughout the year. They are greater than 10% for the year. There is an ICP that is right on the hairy edge that I think rounds to 10% as well.Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.And will that be in the 10-K?Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.That one won't, because it doesn't officially get to 10%.Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.Okay. But the other one will. Okay. Thank you very much.Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.Yeah.OperatorThe next questioner today is Alex Henderson with Needham. Please go ahead.Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLCGreat. I've got a couple of quick questions, if I could. And I'm assuming you're probably not going to answer this, but I'll give it a shot anyway.Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.Go ahead.Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLCYou hit a peak revenue in 2Q of last year. Do you think it's possible to get back to those peak level of revenue that you'd hit in that timeframe during the 2018 timeframe, or is this going to be a much slower? And I'm really just – I'm not really looking for that specific number, but using that as a benchmark to determine what the slope looks like in your mind.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.Alex, I wake up every day wanting to come to battle believing that we can build a multi-billion-dollar company here. So, every part of me says, sure, we can do that. But I want you to walk away and allow me – why don't you hold off to that question until we start seeing traction with gen two – I mean, our ICE4. And that's going to be dependent upon it. Do I think that we've demonstrated multiple years of 25%, 24% year-over-year growth? We have. We did that as a single-market company. Now, we're in multiple markets. So, I think the opportunity is tremendous, but I'm just cautious of telling you, gosh, that can happen in 2018. If it happens in 2018, it's going to be based upon the adoption of ICE4.Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLCSimilar question, as I'm looking at 2017, is it reasonable to think we can at least get back to quarterly profitability in the back half as sort of at least a standing target?Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.Yes.Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLCGood. And then, the third question I had for you is more on the technology side. So, you talked a lot about ICE4, but I didn't hear anything about your ASIC chip and what are you doing on the DSP side of the equation? Obviously, there has been a lot of noise around that front out of both Acacia and then with the AI chip out of Ciena. I would expect that your DSP development cycle time has got to improve substantially. Can you talk a little bit about when do you expect to get another one of the – another turn of that out? And does the impact of the acquisition by Inphi impact that at all?David F. Welch - Infinera Corp.Yeah. So, I'll try and give you some insight into that. A couple things, to reiterate what Tom mentioned in the conference call. First was we've demonstrated the PIC technology that is consistent with 600-gig per wave demonstration that we are demonstrating that in our lab today. And if you look back on history, if we're demonstrating our PIC capability, then we're obviously doing that with a plan to bring it into market in not immediate, but not-too-distant future from that.Our DSP technologies that we're going to bring in and productize will be consistent with that 600-gig per wavelength capability. We have upped the ante in investments for our DSP and ASIC capability as well as our higher capacity PIC technologies. And we expect that to move along, as Tom also stated, at about a two-year rate. And that's moving along. We haven't talked at all about who our partners have been in the past, nor who our partners are in the future.We continue to evaluate to make sure that we can bring the highest-performing product to market and utilize what technologies that are available to that. We'll continue to move down a path of vertically integrate where it makes sense and where it creates differentiation and continue to utilize technologies that are available too on the outside, when that makes sense.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.Yeah, Alex, One of the things – when I say PIC, I mean our PIC. When I say ICE, it's a combined PIC plus DSP, plus all of the stuff that goes around that. So we're going to make a differentiated commentary on that. We need to talk about PIC as a technology. ICE is an enabling capability that will bring customers useful value in our products.OperatorOur next questioner today is Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLCYeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to go back to the product availability. You guys are saying it's all on track. I thought that in the Analyst Day, you had said the CX2 would ship for revenue in Q2. And it sounds like, Tom I thought you said ship for revenue in next couple of months, which would put you potentially in Q1. So, it feels like, to me, you're a little bit ahead, a month or two ahead of your original timeline on that, maybe a little bit more. So...Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.No, Rod – yeah.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.We're roughly – when I say a couple of months, that puts us, two months from now is middle of April. You should think about it in ship and revenue in Q2.Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLCOkay. And then XT, I thought you said right on the heels of the CX2? So, there is no – any chance of XT revenues in Q2? Or you're saying – I know you said Q3, but...Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.I said there's a chance in Q2, but from a conservative perspective if you're thinking about it, think about Q3. Our goal is clearly Q2 internally.Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLCOkay.David F. Welch - Infinera Corp.And then, just for clarity on that, revenue comes about, on an XT, it requires a whole network to be certified, not a point-to-point connection certified. So, the time from when it leaves our factory to the time that we can recognize revenue is longer for that product than for the CX2.Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLCOkay. Yeah. I just felt like maybe you were a little bit ahead of what you thought you'd do in the Analyst Day.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.I never want my engineers to hear that, Rod. I consider us distinctly behind where I want us to be.Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLCOkay. Okay. The second thing, you mentioned this North American cable operator and orders there.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.Yeah.Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLCCan you give us any more color on that? Are those orders for production deployment? Are those orders for testing? I mean, where are you with that? How big is that deal? When does that revenue ramp?Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.I can't unfortunately give you a lot more than I've already given you, but it's a TM-Series. It was orders we received in Q4 for production. And I will give you the – we've had follow-on orders in Q1 to extend the original footprint. And as we've learned the hard lesson on metro, that's how it grows. It's a little bit, followed by a little bit more, followed by a little more as you expand across the footprint. We're excited about the opportunity. It's been a journey. And we stayed at it, and I think we have proven to them that we are providing a differentiated value proposition. It's slow, but it's ramping. And like I said – like a sales guy said, the first order, it's not a customer. It's a customer when you have the second production order. So, we've had more than our second production order now. But do think small upfront that has the opportunity to scale, I think, substantively over time.Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.Yeah. And Rod, this type of customer is a – when we talk about a couple of customers being able to pay for the deal by themselves, these are the type of guys we're talking about.Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLCOkay. And then I also – the other thing I wanted to just clarify, I was surprised you had six new CX customers given the CX2 is kind of right out there coming. Are those guys intending to convert to CX2 or they just don't need the capacity of CX2? Can you just explain how it is you're gaining that many customers on the CX platform prior to CX2?Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.Yeah. Sure. Go ahead.David F. Welch - Infinera Corp.Yeah. I mean, the CX2 is a much higher-capacity box. Lots of customers and applications that prefer a lower capacity box in that scenario. So, we expect to – as we transition for the very high capacity data centers, the dominant, that will transition to CX2. But there's a huge base of opportunity for our current CX products.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.Yeah. There's a whole bunch of customers out there, Rod, who have much smaller data centers. We're selling now to enterprises that have small data centers that they want to interconnect to. We are selling into...David F. Welch - Infinera Corp.Internationally.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp....internationally, with very small capabilities. We're selling to a colo as using it for floor interconnect inside of a colo. So, this application, when we talk about data center architectures starting to migrate into other places of the network, that's what we're talking about. And typically, they will have much, much lower capacity requirements than the top ICPs, where 500-gig is actually a fairly substantive amount of capability. That's great for us, because if you're looking at 100 or 200-gig, we have a great TM solution. If you're looking for 500-gig to 1 terabit, we have the CX. And then the CX2 is for multi-terabits. So, I think we have a complete suite of products now that can address any one of these applications, whether from ICP or down to an enterprise or bank.Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLCGreat. Okay. That's helpful, guys. Thanks, and good job on the results.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.Thank you.Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.Thanks.OperatorThe next questioner today is Patrick Newton with Stifel. Please go ahead.Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.Yeah. Good afternoon, Tom, Dave, and Brad.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.Hey, Pat.Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.I guess, first just a clarification. Tom, you were talking earlier about kind of seasonal – the normal seasonality of second quarter off of a seasonally softer first quarter.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.Yeah.Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.Given you have relatively depressed revenue levels, you have some new product ramps, specifically the CX2 shipping, were you implying that we should see above-seasonal 2Q growth?Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.No, I'm not trying to imply that. I'm just saying that Q1 is, typically, in our industry and for us, as we've gone into more markets, a softer quarter. Typically, 2Q starts coming back reasonably well, because Q1 budgets are understood. I think this year, as I mentioned on the call, we typically had a large cable customer that made most of their orders in the end of Q1. That's not going to likely happen moving forward. It's going to be more distributed through the year. So, it makes Q1 a little more difficult and it could make Q2 a little more difficult, because they typical ordered in late Q1, we shipped a lot of it in Q2. I think for a year perspective, it doesn't matter. So I think, at this point, Q2 I don't anticipate – I would anticipate it growing, but I wouldn't assume any kind of step function.Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.Great. Thanks for the clarification. And then, I guess, for Tom or Brad, given you now plan to release ICE updates every two years and you've expanded your product portfolio well beyond long-haul, should we anticipate increased R&D intensity relative to prior cycles?Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.No. Patrick, we talked about before that the levels will be little bit elevated this year in the mid- to high-20s just because of the lower revenue levels. But our model going forward will continue to be 20% of revenue in R&D. As Dave mentioned, we will likely utilize the mix of internal solutions and solutions available in the market, which will help absorb some of that spend. And I think we do a very good job internally of making sure that we optimize what we spend on, spend in the right ways. But you shouldn't expect the overall levels to be away from our normal targets.Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.Great. And then, I guess, Tom or Dave, I think last quarter you talked about pursuing metro opportunities in mobile front-haul and back-haul, I think you referred to them as edge opportunities and seemed pretty excited about that. I'm curious if you can update us on whether any of those opportunities have turned into wins? And if so, how we should think about revenue ramping?David F. Welch - Infinera Corp.Yeah. The back-haul opportunities continue to grow. We're still seeing good success there. The front-haul opportunities are really a technology transition play. We've got a strong offering. We've had some early wins in that. We're involved in a number of RFI to RFP capabilities with some large Tier 1s. But the transition in that technology and the transition as I think about 5G rollouts, et cetera, it's going to take some time in there. And much like we're seeing with our metro cable guy, when they start making these decisions from the time of the decisions to large revenue ramp can take some time.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.I think we've won somewhere in the neighborhood of three to five front-haul opportunities and most of them have been in Asia, which is not surprising since we often see them pushing these architectures first. The question is going to be can we take that learning, take that attraction and transport it into other geographies, and I think it's too early to call. Do I think it's a substantive potential opportunity? I do. But a lot of it's going to be depending on if we can take that traction that we're achieving in Asia and replicate that elsewhere, and it's just too early to call.OperatorThe next questioner today is Michael Genovese with MKM Properties – sorry, MKM Partners. Please go ahead.Michael E. Genovese - MKM Partners LLCGreat. Thanks a lot. I wanted to ask about R&D intensity this year in 2017, because from the Analyst Day, I remember mid-20s and I heard you on this call say mid- to high-20s. So, first of all, is that new? And secondly, is that more of a statement on more R&D than you would have thought before, or is it a statement on the revenue levels for the year as it's shaping up right now?Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.Yeah. So, Mike, it's not a change from what we were expecting. We're just clarifying, it was a mid- to high-20s levels. Obviously, we're going to spend the dollars required to get the new suite of products out. And that's going to take lots of protos and lots of spending in R&D to make sure those things happen. So, it's nothing different than what we were anticipating before.Michael E. Genovese - MKM Partners LLCOkay. Next question then, you spoke about this goal to win metro – new metro products into existing customers. What are your thoughts on winning brand-new customers with your new metro products late this year or into next year?Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.Well, I certainly think we'll be able to do that. Yeah. There's no question. I mean our sales force is chomping at the bit. And we don't say go target our current customers, we say go sell a bunch of product, and I think there is a lot of opportunity. Having said that, the easier sale is to somebody who already understands and appreciates the Infinera experience, already has a substantive Infinera footprint; that's a more likely sale. It's been impeded a little bit by all these acquisitions that have occurred, but we're making progress selling, cross-selling into our networks, both DTN-X, selling them the TM, and also some TM trying to sell them DTN-Xs.So, I think that our goal is to sell pervasively everywhere. But the easiest sale – quite frankly, none of them are easy – is peoples, they truly do value the Infinera experience and we need to compel them with the TM – upgraded TM. I think the challenge has been, to a degree, like, Tom, we like the TM, we like Infinera a lot, but until we get 16QAM out, we're not going to certify this product. So, I think the 16QAM opens up doors to customers who have articulated a desire to at least evaluate the TM, but they want to do it on a technology that's fresh versus longer in the tooth.Michael E. Genovese - MKM Partners LLCOkay. And then, last one for me, I took away from this that you did well in the fourth quarter in EMEA, in DCI, and I think in Transmode. And then the first quarter guidance is actually pretty good, all things considered, better than what you said was seasonally normal for the industry. So, my question is, do you expect a big EMEA contribution in the first quarter that's – and with the same sort of things that drove the fourth quarter, is that in the guidance or are we going to get somehow shift back to North America or a different region?Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.Mike, I think EMEA will continue to be strong. I think we've always had a strong customer base there. And now with the broader product set and the ICP starting to move some of their spend to EMEA, I think that will continue to be a strong region. And we've got a very good sales team there and tremendous amount of opportunity.Michael E. Genovese - MKM Partners LLCThanks for the questions, guys.Brad D. Feller - Infinera Corp.Yeah.OperatorThis concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Fallon for any closing remarks.Thomas J. Fallon - Infinera Corp.Thank you for joining us this afternoon and for all of your questions. I look forward to updating you in the near term and next quarter. Have a great day.OperatorThe conference is now concluded. Thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.")
